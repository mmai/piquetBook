<h1 id="description-of-the-game">Description of the game</h1>
<h2 id="introductory">Introductory</h2>
<p>The Game of Piquet is played by two persons, with a pack of thirty-two cards - the sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos, being thrown out from a complete pack. It is convenient to have two packs, each being used alternately.</p>
<h2 id="dealing">Dealing</h2>
<p>The players cut for deal. The highest has choice. The order of the cards, both in cutting, and in calling and playing, is ace (highest), king,queen, knave, ten, nine, eight, seven (lowest).</p>
<p>The pack is then cut by the non-dealer, or elder hand, to the dealer, or younger hand, who reunites the packets and gives the top two cards to his adversary, the next two to himself, and soon, dealing two cards at a time to each player, until they have twelve cards apiece. Or, the deal may be by three at a time. The dealer places the undealt cards (called the stock), eight in number, face downwards on the table between the players. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/">Laws 1-17</a>)</p>
<h2 id="discarding">Discarding</h2>
<p>The players then look at their hands and proceed to discard, i.e., to put out such cards as they deem advisable (but see <a href="#carte-blanche-pique-and-repique">carte blanche</a>). They then take in an equivalent number of cards from the stock. The elder hand has the privilege of thus exchanging five of his cards. He may take any less number, but he must exchange one. He separates his discard from his hand, places it aside, face downwards on the table, and takes from the top of the stock the number of cards discarded.</p>
<p>If the elder hand takes all his five cards he leaves three for the younger hand. If he discards less than five cards (leaving more than three in the stock) he announces the fact by saying, "I only take four", or three, or less, as the case may be; or, "I leave a card", or two, or more cards, as the case may be.</p>
<p>When the elder hand discards less than five cards he is entitled to look at the cards he leaves. For example: If he discards four cards, he takes the top four cards of the stock, and looks at the fifth, the one left on the top of the stock after he has taken his four. If he discards but three cards, he may similarly look at the two cards left, and so on. He returns the cards thus looked at to the top of the stock without showing them to his adversary.</p>
<p>The younger hand has the privilege of discarding three cards. He is obliged to discard one.</p>
<p>If the elder hand has left any of his cards, the younger hand may take all that remain in the stock, discarding an equal number. Thus, if the elder hand has left one card, the younger may take four, viz., the one left and his own three. He separates his discard from his hand,and lays it aside as explained in respect of the elder hand; and, in a similar way, takes his cards from the stock after the elder hand has taken in.</p>
<p>Whether the elder hand takes all his cards or not, the younger hand must take his cards from the top of the stock, including any card or cards that may have been left by the elder hand. For instance, the elder hand takes four cards; the younger hand only takes two, and leaves two cards. He must take the card left by the elder hand and the top card of the other three, and must leave the bottom two.</p>
<p>If the younger hand leaves any cards, he announces the number left. He has a right to look at cards he leaves, at any time before he plays to the first trick, but not afterwards. He must declare whether he will look at them or notas soon as the elder hand has named the suit he will first lead (which he generally does by leading a card). If the younger hand looks at them, or at any of them, he must also show all that are left to the elder hand, the elder hand first naming the suit he will lead. If the younger hand elects not to look at the cards left, the elder cannot see them.</p>
<p>Cards left untaken, and not looked at, must be kept separate from the hands and discards.</p>
<p>Each player may look at his own discard at any time during the play of the hand; but he must keep his discard separate from his other cards. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#discarding-and-taking-in">Laws 21-45</a>)</p>
<h2 id="calling-and-showing">Calling and showing</h2>
<p>The discarding and taking in being over, the players next announce or <em>call</em> certain combinations of the cards in hand, and, if good, score for them. These combinations are point, sequences, and quatorzes and trios.</p>
<p>The point must be announced first (<a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#calling-and-showing">Law 46</a>). It is scored by the player who calls the suit of greatest number. If each player's best suit contains an equal number of cards, the point is then scored by the one who calls the suit of greatest strength, according to the following way of valuing it: The ace is valued at eleven, each of the court cards at ten apiece, and the other cards at the number of pips on each.</p>
<p>The elder hand calls his point, thus: Suppose his best suit to consist of five cards. He would call, "Five cards." If the younger hand has no suit of equal or greater number, he replies, "Good." The elder hand then names the suit, saying, "In spades" or as the case may be, and counts one for each card, saying, "Five."</p>
<p>If the point called by the elder hand happens to be equal in number to the best suit of his adversary, the younger hand says "Equal". The elder then announces the value of his cards. Thus: the elder's point is ace, king, knave, nine, eight; he would say, "Forty-eight" or, "Making eight". If the younger hand's five cards make less than forty-eight, he replies, "Good", and the elder then names the suit. If the younger hand's point makes exactly forty-eight, he says,"Equal". The elder hand then names the suit in which his equality is, but does not count anything for it.</p>
<p>If the younger hand's five cards make more than forty-eight, he says, "Not good", and the elder hand does not name the suit he called.</p>
<p>If the younger hand has a point consisting of a greater number of cards than the one called by his adversary, he says, "Not good", and the elder does not name the suit he called.</p>
<p>When the younger hand's point is equal, he names the suit after the elder has finished calling his hand and has led a card, but he does not count anything for point. If the younger hand's point is good, he names the suit and reckons one for each card of the point as soon as the elder has led a card.</p>
<p>A player calling a point which is smaller than his best suit, can correct his miscall before the younger hand has answered "Not good" or "Equal."</p>
<p>It is usual, but not compulsory, to call sequences next after point: quatorze or trio maybe called before sequence, without prejudice to a subsequent call of sequence.</p>
<p>The elder hand should first call his best sequence. Any three or more cards of the same suit held in hand in the order given previously constitute a sequence. Sequences, and the amounts reckoned for them when good, are as under:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A sequence of</th>
<th>eight</th>
<th>cards (named a</th>
<th>huitieme )</th>
<th>scores</th>
<th>eighteen.</th>

</table>
<p>It will be observed that tierces and quarts reckon one for each card; and that higher sequences reckon one for each card, with ten added.</p>
<p>Sequences are further defined by name according to the card which heads them. Thus, a sequence of king, queen, knave, is named a tierce to a king; ace, king, queen, is called a tierce major; and so on for other sequences headed by an ace. A sequence of nine, eight, seven, is called a tierce minor; and so on for other sequences of the lowest cards.</p>
<p>Whether or not a sequence is good is determined by (a) the number of cards it contains, and by (b) the highness of the cards. A higher sequence is superior to or good against a lower one containing the same number of cards; but a sequence containing a greater number of cards, even though low ones, is good against a higher sequence containing fewer cards. For example : A tierce major is good against any other tierce; a quart minor is good against a tierce major.</p>
<p>The elder hand, when calling his sequence, names it thus : "A quint minor," "A quart to a queen", or whatever it may be. The younger hand says, "Good", "Equal", or "Not good", as in the case of the point. If good or equal, the elder hand then names the suit in which his sequence is. If not good, the younger calls his sequence, and names the suit in which it is, after the elder has finished calling and has led a card.</p>
<p>When a player has a sequence that is good, he reckons one for each card of it, and an additional ten if it is a sequence of five or more cards. The player whose sequence is allowed to be good, is also entitled to reckon all smaller sequences in his hand, notwithstanding that his adversary holds a sequence of intermediate value. For example: A has a quart to a queen (queen, knave, ten, nine) in one suit and a tierce minor (nine, eight, seven) in another suit; B has a quart to a knave (knave, ten, nine, eight) in a third suit. A calls a quart to a queen, which is good. He scores four for it, and then calls the tierce minor, and scores three for that. B's quart to a ten counts nothing, and does not prevent A from reckoning the tierce minor.</p>
<p>If the two players' sequences are equal, the equality is called by both, and neither scores anything for sequence, even though one player may hold a second sequence of equal value, or an inferior sequence. The equality of the superior sequence nullifies the whole. Thus :  A calls a tierce major; B says, "Equal". A and B are precluded from scoring a second tierce major or any smaller sequence.</p>
<p>If the elder hand inadvertently calls a low sequence, holding a higher one, he may correct his miscall before it has been replied to by the younger hand. After the younger hand has replied, "Good",, or "Equal", the elder must abide by his call, and can only reckon sequences equal to, or lower than, the one he called. Thus : A has a quart minor and a tierce minor. If he first calls a tierce minor, and it is admitted to be good, he can reckon two tierce minors, but he cannot reckon the quart.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this. If the elder hand calls a sequence that is good against the cards (i.e., better than any sequence the younger hand could possibly have in hand and discard taken together), he can reckon any sequence he holds, even though it is better than the one first called. For example: A has a quart to a king, and a tierce to a queen, good against the cards. If he first calls a tierce to a queen, he may afterwards reckon his quart.</p>
<p>Some players show all that they claim as good or equal; this, however, is not compulsory, unless the cards are asked for.</p>
<p>As the law now stands, calling is equivalent to showing. Hence, if A calls, say, "Forty-eight in diamonds," the only diamonds he can hold being ace, knave, ten, nine, eight, B is deemed to know that A holds a quart. A forgets to reckon his quart, and leads a card. B cannot reckon any equal or inferior sequence. If A remembers he has not reckoned the quart, he can rectify the omission before B has played to the first trick (See <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#calling-and-showing">Law 56</a> and <a href="../casesAndDecisions/#case-iv">Case IV.</a>).</p>
<p>The younger hand is not bound to call his best sequence first. Thus, if the elder has called a tierce major, and the younger has replied, "Not good", the younger is at liberty to show and count a tierce minor first, and then a quart or larger sequence. The reason for the difference between the elder and younger hands in this respect is that the younger is only reckoning (adding up his score); but the elder is ascertaining whether what he calls is good, and, by calling a lower sequence before a higher, he might gain information as to the contents of his opponent's hand to which he is not entitled. The elder hand, however, having called a sequence which is good, may reckon lower sequences in any order for the same reason, viz., that he is then only adding up his score.</p>
<p>After sequence, quatorzes (i.e.,four aces, kings, queens, knaves, or tens), or trios (three of any of these), are called and reckoned as before, except that in this combination there can be no equality. Quatorzes or trios of cards smaller than tens are of no value. A quatorze, if good, reckons fourteen (one for each card with ten added); a trio if good counts three. Any quatorze is good against a trio; thus, four tens are good against three aces. If each player has a quatorze the highest is good; the same if each has a trio; and, as in the case of sequences, anything that is good enables the player to count all smaller combinations of four or three in his hand, and nullifies any that the adversary may hold of intermediate value. For example: A has four tens and three knaves; B, three aces. A. scores fourteen for tens, and three for knaves; and B does not count his aces.</p>
<p>A quatorze or trio is called thus: "Four aces", "Three queens", or as the case may be. The younger hand then says: "Good", or "Not good", as before. The cards of a quatorze or trio are never shown on the table. The adversary, however, has a right to demand their production if he thinks fit.</p>
<p>The reason that quatorzes are not shown is that when aces, kings, queens, knaves, or tens are called, the adversary knows what the cards are. When a player might hold a quatorze, but only calls three of that rank (as, e.g. A calls three kings, when he might have held four), the adversary is entitled to know which card is not reckoned. In the case of the example given, B might say, "Show your kings", by which means he would ascertain the king that is not called. But the usual course is for B to say, "Which king do you not reckon?", and A is bound to reply.</p>
<p>In calling quatorzes or trios the elder hand should call his best first, as, if he calls a lower one, he cannot afterwards reckon a higher one, unless the lower one is good against the cards. If the one first called is good, any lower ones may be reckoned without regard to order, as in the case of sequences.</p>
<p>The younger hand may reckon his quatorzes or trios, if good, in any order. He is not obliged first to call his best, and he may rectify a miscall of any kind until he has played to the first trick,for the reason already given.</p>
<p>After the elder hand has finished calling, and has reckoned all that he has good, he leads a card. Before playing to this card, the younger hand reckons all that he has good, or calls all that he has equal.</p>
<p>A player is not bound to call anything unless he pleases, and he may always call less than he holds, if he does not desire to expose his hand. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#calling-and-showing">Laws 46-56</a>)</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>The players having called what they have good or equal, and reckoned what they have good,next proceed to play the hands. The elder hand leads any card he pleases, and his opponent plays to it. The younger hand must follow suit if able, but otherwise he may play any card he thinks fit.</p>
<p>Two cards, one played by each player, constitute a trick. The trick is won by the player who plays to it the higher card of the suit led. A player is not obliged to win the card led unless he chooses, if he can follow suit without. The winner of the trick leads to the next, and soon, until all the twelve cards in each hand a replayed out.</p>
<p>During the play the leader counts one for each card led. He counts one whether he wins the trick or not. If the leader wins the trick, his adversary counts nothing in play; but if the second player wins the trick, he also counts one.The winner of the trick again counts one for the card he next leads, and so on.</p>
<p>The winner of the last trick counts two instead of one.</p>
<p>The tricks are left face upwards on the table in front of the player who wins them. They may be examined by either player at any time.</p>
<p>If each player wins six tricks, the cards are divided, and there is no further score. If one player wins more than six tricks (called winning the cards), he adds ten to his score, beyond what he has counted in hand and play. If one player wins every trick (called winning a capot), he adds forty to his score instead of ten: ten for the cards and thirty for the capot.</p>
<p>All cards scored for as good, or called as equal, must be exhibited to the adversary if demanded during the play of the hand. This, however, does not apply to a call of an equal number of cards for point by the younger hand, when the strength of his point is inferior to that of the elder's. Among players, the cards are not as a rule exhibited; but all necessary questions with regard to them are replied to. Thus: A scores a point of five cards, and plays three of them. Presently, B wants to refresh his memory, so he says, "How many of your point have you ?", or "How many spades?", or as the case may be; and A is bound to reply "Two". Similarly, if A had scored three kings, B is entitled to a reply to the question "What kings have you in hand?", or B might ask, "Have you anything in hand that you have called ?", then A must tell him. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#playing">Laws 57-60</a>)</p>
<h2 id="carte-blanche-pique-and-repique">Carte blanche, pique and repique</h2>
<p>In the foregoing pages carte blanche, pique and repique have been omitted in order to simplify the description of the game.</p>
<p>If either player has dealt to him a hand which contains neither king, queen, nor knave, he holds carte blanche. This entitles him to score ten. Before he takes in he must show the carte blanche by dealing his cards quickly one on top of the other, face upwards on the table, after which he retakes them into his hand. If either player has carte blanche, he must inform his adversary at once, by saying, "I have a carte blanche", or "Discard for carte blanche." As soon as the adversary has discarded, the carte blanche is shown to him. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#carte-blanche">Laws 18-20</a>)</p>
<p>If the elder hand scores, <em>in hand and play</em>,  thirty or more before his adversary counts anything that hand, he wins a <em>pique</em>. A <em>pique</em> entitles the player to add thirty to his score; but in all other respects the hand is played as already explained. For example : A has a quint major, which is good for point and sequence, and three aces, which are also good. He counts twenty for the point and quint, and three for the aces, and then leads the quint major and the two aces, or one of the aces and some other card. This makes him thirty; and, as his adversary has not scored anything, it is a <em>pique</em>. A, when he leads the card which makes him thirty, instead of counting "Thirty", counts "Sixty". It is not necessary that the card led which makes thirty should win the trick. The elder hand, having reckoned twenty-nine when his adversary has reckoned nothing, and having the lead, wins a <em>pique</em> even if he leads a losing card.</p>
<p>If a player scores, <em>in hand alone</em>, thirty points or more by scores that reckon in order before anything that his adversary can count, he wins a <em>repique</em>. A <em>repique</em> entitles the player to add sixty to his score. Thus: If a player has point, quint, and quatorze (all good), he <em>repiques</em> his adversary. He counts five for point, fifteen for sequence, making twenty, and fourteen for quatorze, making thirty-four. Instead of counting "Thirty-four," he counts "Ninety-four." In all other ways, the hand is played as already explained.</p>
<p>Equalities do not save a <em>pique</em> or a <em>repique</em>. In the case of an equality, the game proceeds as though no such mode of scoring existed. Thus: A has point equal, quint and quatorze, both good, and leads a card. He wins a pique.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>During the progress of the hand, each player continues to repeat aloud the amount of his score that hand for the time being. At the end of the hand, the number scored is written on a scoring card, each player recording both his own and his opponent's score, in separate columns.</p>
<p>Although the scores are, for the sake of convenience, recorded only at the end of the hand, they are recordable when they accrue, whether made by the elder or younger hand, in the order given in the following table of precedence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carte blanche.</li>
<li>Point.</li>
<li>Sequences.</li>
<li>Quatorzes and trios.</li>
<li>Points made in play.</li>
<li>The cards.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to bear in mind this order of accretion in the case of piques or repiques. Thus, a pique can only be won by the elder hand, as the card he leads counts one in play before the younger hand plays; hence it stops a pique. But the one reckoned by the elder hand, when he leads his first card, does not prevent his being repiqued if he has nothing good, and the younger hand can score thirty or more in hand, because scores in hand reckon before points made in play. So, also, if the elder hand scores thirty or more in hand, he does not necessarily gain a repique. Thus he may have a quint (good), a tierce, and a quatorze(good). But if his point is not good, he does not gain a repique, although he scores thirty-two in hand alone; because the younger hand's point is recordable in order before the sequences and quatorze.</p>
<p>To take another example; A (elder hand) has a huitième (good for twenty-six) and a tierce (good for three more). He then leads a card, and thus reaches thirty. B (younger hand) has three tens which are good. The three tens save a pique, as they reckon in order before the point made in play by A.</p>
<p>Carte blanche, taking precedence of all other scores, saves piques and repiques. Carte blanche counts towards piques and repiques just the same as other scores. Thus: A player showing a carte blanche, and, after discarding, having point and quint (both good), would repique his adversary.</p>
<p>A capot does not count towards a pique, as the forty for the capot is added after the play of the hand is over. For instance: A (elder hand) has ace, king, queen, knave, eight of spades; ace,king, knave, ten, eight, seven of hearts; and ace of diamonds. His point and quart are good.These, with three aces, reckon thirteen. He wins every trick, and his total score is twenty-six. He adds forty for the capot, making him sixty-six. He does not gain a pique, as he only made twenty-six in hand and play.</p>
<p>A player who reckons nothing that deal as a penalty (see <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#calling-and-taking-in">Laws 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35</a>, <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#playing">54 and 58</a>) is not piqued or repiqued if he holds any cards which, but for the penalty, would have scored before his adversary reached thirty. His cards though not good to score, are good to bar his adversary.</p>
<p>A partie consists of six deals, each player dealing three times. The partie is won by the player who makes the higher score in six deals. If both players score the same number, each deals once more. If there is a second tie, the partie is drawn.</p>
<p>By agreement the partie may consist of only four deals, the scores in the first and last deals counting double. In case of a tie, each deals once more, the scores in the extra deals counting single.</p>
<p>The winner of a partie deducts the points scored by his opponent from his own, and adds a hundred to the difference. Thus : A scores in the six deals 131; B scores 113. A wins 131 - 13 = 118 points. Should the loser score less than a hundred in the six deals, the winner (whether he has made a hundred or not), adds the points scored by his adversary to his own, instead of deducting them, and also adds a hundred to his score. Thus: A scores 125; B scores 81. A wins 125 + 181= 306. This is called winning a <em>rubicon</em>. (See also <a href="../lawsOfPiquet/#scoring">Laws 61-74</a>)</p>
<p>When, during the last hand of a partie, a player finds (before the play of the hand begins) that he cannot save his rubicon, he is not required to count any points in play. He throws down his hand, and tells his adversary to count every trick (thirteen), and the cards (ten). He may, if he pleases, play to divide the cards; but in that case, he has to add to his score the points he makes in play. Or, his adversary may play for a capot; but that does not affect the case, as, if capoted, the loser has no points in play to score.</p>
<p>Scoring cards and pencils are required. The diagram shows a card ruled for six parties,or for five parties if the totals are recorded on the same card.</p>
<p>The game is played for so much a point, or for so much a hundred, odd money not being reckoned in the final total. Thus : A and B play five parties, at ten shillings a hundred (about equal to half-crown points at whist). A wins 75 points, as shown by the card. Fractions of fifty points are not reckoned ; A wins five shillings. Some players only neglect fractions of twenty-five points; this should be agreed beforehand. Two penny points are reckoned at a pound a hundred, fractions of fifty points not counting in the final total. Three-penny points are not reckoned by the hundred, but by multiples of forty, fractions of forty points not counting; hence 75 points only score as 40. At six penny or shilling points, fractions of a pound are excluded in reckoning the finals; 75 points, therefore, only score as 60.</p>

<p>At chouette piquet, the points of each partie are reckoned as multiples of ten, adding one to the tens for units above five, and neglecting units from one to five. Thus, 416 counts 420; 141 counts 140. As the score must always end in a naught, the naughts are omitted when entering the figures. Taking, as an example, the parties on the scoring card, the totals might be entered as under:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>First Partie</th>
<th>Second Partie</th>
<th>Third Partie</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A + 30</td>
<td>A + 84</td>
<td>A - 96</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B - 15</td>
<td>B - 42</td>
<td>B + 48</td>
<td>etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C - 15</td>
<td>C - 42</td>
<td>C + 48</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Instead of writing each score at length, as above, and taking out the results at the end, it is found convenient in practice to add and subtract the totals after every partie, and to keep a separate scoring card for that purpose, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>  A + 30 + 114 + 18 + 32 + 19
  B - 15 -  57 -  9 - 37 - 50
  C - 15 -  57 -  9 +  5 + 31
</code></pre>
<p>A wins 190 ; C, 310 ; B loses 500. At ten shillings a hundred, when fractions of fifty points are not reckoned, A wins 150 (or fifteen shillings) ; C wins 300 (or thirty shillings). B, on the score, actually loses 500 (or fifty shillings); but in consequence of fractional parts of fifty points not counting in the final total of amounts receivable, B gets off with a loss of forty-five.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>The following Example will show more distinctly than mere description the mode of playing the game. The reader, if previously unacquainted with Piquet, is advised, after reading the Description of the Game, to play over the Example, and then to re-peruse the description. When playing the Example, it is advisable, in the case of learners, to place the cards face upwards on the table.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are the players.<br />
<strong>A</strong> (elder hand) has dealt him ace, king, knave of spades; ace, queen, knave, eight of hearts;knave, eight, seven of clubs; and nine, eight of diamonds.<br />
He discards king of spades; eight, seven of clubs; and nine, eight of diamonds.<br />
He takes in nine, eight of spades; king of hearts; nine of clubs; and king of diamonds.<br />
<strong>B</strong> (younger hand) has ten, seven of spades;ten, nine, seven of hearts; king, queen, ten of clubs; and ace, queen, knave, ten of diamonds.<br />
He discards seven of spades; and nine, seven of hearts.<br />
He takes in queen of spades; ace of clubs;and seven of diamonds.<br />
The game then proceeds thus:-<br />
<strong>A</strong> (calls his point), "Five cards."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (says), "What do they make?"<br />
<strong>A</strong> (replies), "Forty-nine," or "Making nine."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (replies), "Good."<br />
<strong>A</strong> (says), " In hearts; and quart major."<br />
<strong>B</strong>, "Good."<br />
<strong>A</strong> (counting his point and sequence), " Five and four are nine." " Three knaves ? "<br />
<strong>B</strong>, "Not good."<br />
<strong>A</strong> (leads ace of hearts, and says), "Ten."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (says), " Four tens fourteen, and three queens seventeen." (Plays the ten of hearts, j<br />
<strong>A</strong> (leads all the hearts, and says), " Eleven,twelve, thirteen, fourteen."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (plays seven, ten, knave, and queen of diamonds, and, repeating his score, says), "Seventeen."<br />
<strong>A</strong> now has five tricks, and, in order to win the cards, he should lead anything but a spade; for B,having called queens and tens, must have queen,ten of spades.<br />
<strong>A</strong> (leads king of diamonds, and says), "Fifteen."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (wins with ace of diamonds, and says)," Eighteen."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (leads, ace, king, queen, and ten of clubs,and says), "Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two."<br />
<strong>A</strong> (plays nine, knave of clubs, and eight, nine, of spades, and, repeating his score, says), "Fifteen."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (leads queen of spades, and says), "Twenty-three."<br />
<strong>A</strong> (wins with ace, and says), "Sixteen," (and then leads knave of spades, and says), " Eighteen,"(and then adding the score for the cards, says),"Twenty-eight."<br />
<strong>B</strong> (repeating his score, says), "Twenty-three."A then writes on his scoring card, 28, 23 ; B writes on his card, 23, 28; the cards are gathered up by B, and the other pack is cut for A's deal.</p>
<h2 id="chouette-piquet">Chouette piquet</h2>
<p>Sometimes Piquet is played by three persons. The three players (A, B, C,) cut. The one who cuts the highest card (A) has choice of deal and cards, and plays one partie, <em>a la chouette</em>, against the other two in consultation. The player who cuts the lowest card (C) sits out, and advises B.</p>
<p>If the single player (A) wins the partie, he continues to play against the other two. C takes B's place, and B advises C ; and so on.</p>
<p>As soon as A loses a partie, the player who advised in that partie (say C) takes A's place. B plays against the other two, and A advises C. If C loses, A takes C's place, and C advises A; if C wins, A takes B's place, and B advises A; and so on.</p>
<p>The single player has choice of deal and cards throughout, and plays double stakes, as at dummy.</p>
<p>When a chouette is played, the totals of each partie are recorded on a separate scoring card.</p>
