The Laws of Piquet au cent, differ from those of Piquet in the following particulars: The player who cuts the lower card has to deal. If he exposes more than one card in cutting, his adversary may treat the lowest of the exposed cards as the one cut.

The deal is by two cards at a time.

If the elder hand find that he has a card too many or too few, he has the option of a fresh deal before touching the stock.

If the dealer deal with the wrong pack, and the error be discovered before the deal is completed, there must be a fresh deal with the right pack. If not discovered before the deal is completed, the deal holds good.

If a player deal out of his turn, and discover his error before taking up his hand, the deal in error is void, and the right dealer deals. If not discovered before taking up the hand, there is no remedy.

If the younger hand have a carte blanche, he need not declare it until his adversary has discarded and touched the stock.

The younger hand is not obliged to discard any card.

After a player has touched the stock he cannot alter his discard (except as provided in Laws of Piquet 11, 32, and 38).

If the elder hand mix with his hand one of the three bottom cards of the stock, he loses the game ; and, similarly, if the elder hand, having left a card or cards, mix with his hand any of the cards he ought to have left, he loses the game.

If the younger hand take up any of the top five cards of the stock (not being cards declared to be left by the elder hand), he loses the game.

If the elder hand do not take all his cards,he must declare the number he takes or leaves before touching the stock.

If the younger hand leave any cards and elect not to look at them, and either player should then look at them, they must be exposed, and a suit may be called from the offender when next he has to lead.

If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has thirteen cards, he must discard one more card than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any. He must leave at least three cards for the younger hand.

If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has eleven cards and there are eight in the stock, he must discard one less than he takes in, and he must discard one card. The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any. If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has twelve cards and there are seven in the stock, he must leave at least three cards for the younger hand. The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any.

The elder hand must call the number his point makes. It is not sufficient to call the number of cards of the point.

It is not sufficient to call the number of cards of a sequence. The elder hand must state to what card his sequence is. And, similarly, if he calls a _quatorze_ or _trio_, he is bound to state the value of the cards of which it consists.

If the elder hand call a smaller point, sequence, quatorze or trio than he holds, or a trio when he holds a quatorze, he must abide by his call, and he cannot reckon anything superior, even though his call is good against the cards. He may,however, correct a misnomer of sequence, trio,or quatorze, before he leads a card, and may reckon anything of equal or inferior counting value, provided his call in error was good against the cards.

The elder hand having called anything which is good or equal must show the cards called,except in the case of quatorzes and trios. If he lead a card without showing his call, he cannot reckon it, and the adversary may show and reckon his point or sequence, even though it be equal or inferior to the one called.

If the elder hand show a sequence and call an inferior one, he cannot reckon the superior one; but the show bars the younger hand from reckoning his sequences, if only equal or inferior to the one shown.

The younger hand having allowed a correct call to be good or equal, must abide by his answer.

If the younger hand disallow a call, and it be discovered that the call of the elder hand is good or equal, the elder hand can show and reckon his superiority, or show his equality, notwithstanding that he has led a card.

If the younger hand say equal or not good to a call, and play to the first trick without showing his superiority or equality, the elder may show and reckon what he has called, notwithstanding that he has led a card.

If a player call a quatorze or trio which he does not hold, and it is allowed to be good,and he play a card without correcting the miscall, he can reckon nothing that deal.

When the elder hand has led a card, or the younger hand played to a trick, they cannot reckon anything omitted.

By agreement, points ending in four count one less than the number of cards.

By agreement, in playing the cards, nines,eights, and sevens are not counting cards.

Errors in adding up, or in marking the score,if proved, may be rectified at any time during the game.

A game is one hundred up. A player scoring a hundred before his adversary has scored fifty wins a double game.

A partie is won by a player who wins three games out of five, a double counting as two games.

A player has no choice of cards on commencing a fresh partie.
