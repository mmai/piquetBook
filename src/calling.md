# Calling

## Introductory

Calling is not such a simple matter as at first sight appears.

Your object is to reckon all you can (exceptas will be pointed out), and at the same timenot to expose your hand more than necessary,as by informing your adversary of the contentsof your hand, you materially assist him in play-ing the cards.

After taking in, and before calling, lookthrough your hand, and, if your memory is atfault, through your discard also, to ascertainwhat you have good, or equal, or what remainsgood against you.

CALLING THE POINT.

You should not thoughtlessly call your bestsuit for point, when you have two points. Youshould consider which of the two it is to youradvantage to declare.

For example:-You (elder hand) have king,queen, knave, eight of hearts; and ace, queen,ten, eight of clubs. You call four cards, allowedto be good. You propose to attack in hearts;you should therefore declare that suit for point.

PIQUET. 153

To carry the illustration a step further. Yourother cards are ace of spades, and three diamonds.

You have put out knave, nine, eight of spades,and two diamonds.

You know, or ought to know, that thirty-eight,in hearts, is good against the cards. You callfour cards, and are told that four cards areequal. Your point in clubs makes thirty-nine.But having ascertained that thirty-eight is good,you declare the point in hearts. Your adversarymay then suppose that you are out in clubs, andmay therefore play the cards to a disadvantage.

It may be asked, If you know your point isgood, why not declare it at once?

The answer is that, when you may hold thesame number of cards in more than one suit, itis generally advisaj^le to call the number of cardsof your point, even though good against the cards,in hopes of compelling your adversary to discoversome portion of his hand or discard by his reply.Thus:-You have forty-seven in one suit, andmight have had forty-five in another. The bestpoint the younger hand can hold is forty-six. Ifto your call of "Five cards" he repHes, "Equal,"you know five cards in his hand; if he replies,"Good," you know he has discarded from hispoint.

Again: - If any four-card point which theyounger hand can hold must be good, and youhave a point of thirty-one, you should call threecards, though holding four. You may thus induce

154 PIQUET.

the younger hand to beUeve you have three cardsin each suit, and may consequently gain severalpoints in play. (For an example of a thought-less call of four cards, see p. 175.)

REPLYING TO THE CALL OF POINT.

When you are younger hand, and the elder callsa number of cards for point, equal to yours, youshould not declare the equality if his point mustbe good.

Thus:-The elder hand calls, "Five cards." Youhave already noted that the only five-card suit hecan hold is ace, queen, knave, ten, eight of hearts,making forty-nine. Your five-card suit (ace, queen,knave, ten, seven) only makes forty-eight Youshould not reply, " Equal" to the call of five cards,but should at once allow five cards to be good.

When you reply, " Not good" to a point, youshould at the same time observe in which suitthe call is.

For example: - Elder hand calls five cards.You have already seen that the only five-cardpoint he can hold is in hearts. You, therefore,know five cards in his hand ; this knowledge maybe of great use to you in playing the cards.

Or: - Elder hand calls five cards which areequal. He may then decline to say what theymake, if he knows your five cards must be betterthan his. Nevertheless, if he can only hold onefive-card point, you know what the cards are.Or, he may declare that his cards make, say.

forty-four. Forty-four is not good; all the same,you know that his point consists of five cards,without an ace, and ending in a tierce minor.You will thus probably be able to tell five cardsin your opponent's hand.

The following table, if learnt by heart, willfacilitate a knowledge of the cards of a pointwhich is not good :-

8, two tenth cards, and an ace.four tenth cards.

9, two tenth cards, and an ace.three tenth cards and an ace.

For points from forty-four to fifty-one it is onlynecessary to add a tenth card to these. Forexample:-A point of forty-eight must containeight, and four tenth cards; eight, nine, two tenthcards, and an ace; or seven, three tenth cards,and an ace. Fifty can only be made in oneway, viz., with nine, three tenth cards, and an

ace. Six-card points follow a similar rule; butfor large points, a simpler way of finding thecards that compose them is to see whether youhave in hand, or to remember whether you havein discard, the remaining cards of the suit.

CALLING SEQUENCES.

When, elder hand, you have called a point,which is equal, or not good, and you can con-sequently tell that your sequence in some othersuit is not good, you should not call any se-quence.

For instance:-Your point is forty-one, viz.,ace, king, queen, ten of spades. It is not good.The only better point against you is quart majorand one small diamond. Your best sequence isa quart to a queen in hearts. You should notcall the quart, as it cannot be good or equal,and by calling it you only expose your hand.By not calling it, you leave it doubtful whetheryou have put out any hearts ; and this may beof use to you in playing the cards.

SINKING.

If there is anything good against you, or equal,which is not called, you will jDrobably be, able todiscover some of the cards your adversary has putout This may subsequently assist you in playingthe cards.

But you must not conclude, as a matter ofcourse, that your adversary has discarded what

PIQUET. 157

he does not call. Owing to the advantage inplaying the cards derived from knowing the ad-verse hand, it not unfrequently happens that youradversary will conceal some of his cards, and notcall them, although they may be good. He putsup with the loss of several points in calling hishand, on the chance of afterwards dividing orwinning the cards.

You should be on your guard against thismanoeuvre (called sinking). It is especiallyresorted to when a player has a suit un-guarded, and calling all he holds would exposethe fact.

Your adversary, for instance, is a player whorarely discards from his point. He calls fivecards (good against the cards), and declares fivespades, when he might have six. You shouldimmediately suspect that he may be sinking acard of his point, and should not hesitate toattack him in another suit from which he islikely to have discarded, and in which you havea tenace. The game being for him to keep hisother suits unbroken, you will probably find himunguarded in the suit he has discarded.

Or:-Your adversary may hold a tierce in asuit other than his point. The tierce is good,or equal, and he does not call it. He mayhave put it out; or, he may be unguarded some-where, and calling the tierce would render thisevident; or, he may wish you to attack him inthe suit in which he holds the tierce, and may

PIQUET.

be trying to make you think he has put outthat suit

Again:-He may have a quart to a knave, andmay only call a tierce to a knave, which is good,or equal. Or, he may have a trio which he doesnot call; or, a quatorze, and may only call a trio.

It will be for you to judge of the probabilitiesin these and similar cases, and to act accordingly.You should especially suspect an experiencedplayer of concealing cards which, if called, wouldreveal weakness, affecting the play of the cards,in other places.

It should be added, that it is useless to practisethe stratagem of sinking cards against an indifferentplayer who does not count your hand.

EXAMPLES OF SINKING.

Example I.

The elder hand, having put out three smallhearts and two small clubs, holds the followingcards :-</p>
<div class="calibre7">
<img alt="Picture #37" src="images/000032.jpg" class="calibre1" />
</div>
<p class="calibre5">His point and quart major are admitted to begood. He then proceeds to call a tierce to aking in diamonds (sinking the ten of diamonds-

PIQUET. 159

this must be done without hesitation), in orderto lead his opponent to imagine that the ten ofdiamonds has been discarded, and that the kingof hearts is guarded. He then calls three kings,which are not good. He next leads the spades,and then the king of diamonds, which the ad-versary wins, and leads clubs. To the thirdclub, the elder hand throws (without hesitation)the knave of diamonds, and to the fourth club, thequeen of diamonds. Suppose the younger handnow remains with ace, queen of hearts, and theelder with king of hearts and ten of diamonds.If the younger hand, believing the elder to havetwo hearts (as would seem to him must be thecase, if unacquainted with the ruse), leads hisqueen, in order to win the last trick, the elderhand makes both tricks and wins the cards.</p>
<div class="calibre7">
<img alt="Picture #38" src="images/000058.jpg" class="calibre1" />
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The elder hand's point is equal, the youngerhaving seven hearts. The elder also has fourkings, good against the cards; but, having putout a ten, his three aces and three kings arealso good against the cards.

i6o

PIQUET.

If he calls four kings, he cannot capot hisadversary. He, therefore, calls three aces andthree kings, and declares that he does notreckon the king of hearts. He then leads hisspades, his ace, king of clubs, and ace, king ofdiamonds. His adversary will have to keep onecard, and, as he believes the king of hearts tobe out, he will probably keep either the queenof clubs or of diamonds, and throw away the aceof hearts. If he does so, he is capoted. Theelder hand gives up eleven points by sinking aking, with the moral certainty (except against avery acute or a very stupid player) of gainingthirty-two.

Example III.A (Elder Hand).</p>
<div class="calibre7">
<img alt="Picture #39" src="images/000056.jpg" class="calibre1" />
</div>
<p class="calibre5">B (Younger Hand).

PIQUET. l6l

A has discarded seven of spades; nine, sevenof clubs; and knave, seven of diamonds.

A's point is not good; his tierce is equal. Adoes not call three aces; B reckons point, andthree tens.

A leads the hearts and spades, and remainswith two cards, viz., ace, queen of clubs.

B remains with king, knave of clubs, and aceof diamonds, and has yet to play one card.

If, in consequence of aces not having beencalled, B believes the ace of clubs to be out,he will play knave of clubs, when A will leadace of clubs, and B will be capoted.

A coup such as this will generally succeed inpractice; but it is difficult to see with whatcards A could have gone out to justify the dis-card of the ace of clubs.

B is in a very awkward position. Probablyhis best game is to keep the clubs, as then hesaves the capot, unless A has thrown four clubsand a spade, a most unlikely discard.

When put to a card, the general rule is to countthe cards remaining against {see pp. 170, 171).There is one other consideration, viz., what cardsthe adversary cannot in reason have discarded.Thus:-If a player might have a quart which hedoes not call, and his hand is such that it wouldhave been very bad play to discard from a quart,the presumption is he did not go out with thequart originally, and therefore that he has takenin to that suit {co?iipare Example IV., pp. 162, 163).

<p class="calibre5">B (Younger Hand).

B has discarded nine of clubs; and ten, nineof diamonds.

A calls a point of four cards. He is thereforeout in hearts and diamonds. He has probablygone for clubs and queens. The best four-cardpoint he can hold makes thirty-eight.

B says, " Making? " A replies, " Making eight."B says, " Not good."

The tierce major is equal. B shows ace, knave,ten, eight of spades, for point,. sinking the king,and reckons three aces.

A makes four tricks in clubs. To the fourthclub B plays eight of spades.

PIQUET.

163

A then leads king of diamonds, won by B withthe ace.

B leads tierce major in hearts. To the third heartA, believing king of spades to be out, throws sevenof spades. A wins all the remaining tricks.

A similar feature is to be noticed here as inthe previous example. It is clear that B has aclub and a diamond out. There is no conceiv-able combination of cards with which it wouldbe right for B to discard a club, a diamond, andking of spades. A should see that there is some-thing wrong; and, unless he thinks B has putout the king of spades by mistake, should keephimself doubly guarded in spades.

164 PIQUET.

A has discarded nine, eight, seven of hearts ;and eight, seven of clubs.

He went out with the diamonds and threequeens, and took in king, ten of spades; ace ofhearts; and knave, ten of clubs.

B's discard was knave, ten of hearts; and nineof clubs. He kept a six - card point in spades;ace of clubs; and king, nine of diamonds. Hetook in king of hearts; king of clubs; and sevenof diamonds.

It is the last hand of the partie. A's scoreis seventy - eight; B's score is a hundred andfour.

It is obvious that B must win the partie, evenif he does not reckon his point, All A can score,under the most favourable circumstances, is thirty-three, making him in. B must make six in play;and this, with his three kings, good against thecards, will make him 113.

B should therefore sacrifice his score for point,as, if he can make it appear that he is guarded inhearts, and is therefore not attacked in that suit,he can divide the cards, when A will be rubiconed.A announces five cards. B might ask how manythey make, and score the point, sinking one spade,if A declares hearts. B will immediately be sus-pected, will be attacked in hearts, and A will savethe rubicon, with two tierces, nine in play, and thecards.

B should sink the whole of his point, and allowfive cards to be good. He may still be attacked

PIQUET. 165

in diamonds or in clubs, when he at least dividesthe cards, and A is rubiconed.

It so happens that A's point is in diamonds. Areckons five for point, and two tierces to a queen,in all eleven.

B reckons three kings.

A leads diamonds. B wins the second trickwith the king, and leads ace, queen of spades.A wins the queen, and leads the remaining dia-monds, to which B throws a diamond and twospades. A, supposing B to hold king of heartsguarded, now leads queen of clubs, and B dividesthe cards. If B had called his six-card point, Awould have led ace of hearts, instead of queenof clubs, and would have won the cards.

A scores 98, and is rubiconed.

In the worst possible case that can happen,i.e.^ if A leads ace of hearts instead of queenof clubs, notwithstanding that B is apparentlyguarded in hearts, B, as already pointed out,still wins the partie.
