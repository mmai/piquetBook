# Odds at piquet

## The show

The Show, elder hand (when small cards arecounted in play), is twenty-eight; younger hand isfourteen. That is, it is about an even chance theelder hand will score twenty-eight or more, andthat the younger hand will score fourteen or more.

The above results have been obtained empiri-cally thus :-

This gives fourteen as the show, younger hand.

The show, when small cards are not countedin play (as was formerly the case), is twenty-sevenelder hand and thirteen younger hand. It is notknown how this result was arrived at. It is be-lieved that it can only be obtained by the laboriousmethod of keeping statistics of a large number ofhands, as has now been done for the rubicongame, in which small cards are counted in play.

To Work the Tables.-Add together all thehands which score less than the amount, required;and separately add together all the hands whichscore the number required or more. The sumof the one, as against that of the other, will givethe required odds approximately.

Examples.-(i). It is the last hand of a partie.The elder hand is 90. Required the odds infavour of his saving the rubicon.

The odds are 9023 to 977, or nearly 9^ to ithat he will score 10 or more.

* Of these, 102 times he scored o.

2o6 PIQUET.

(2). Required the odds that the elder hand willscore at least 20.

The odds are 7280 to 2720, or about 8 to 3in his favour.

(3). It is known to be an even chance that theelder hand will score 28 or more. It is thereforeslightly against his scoring at least 30. The tablesgive 5587 to 4413, or about 5 to 4 against.

(4). The odds against the elder hand scoring40 or more are, according to the tables, 7692 to2308, or about 10 to 3.

(5). It is the last hand of the partie. The elderhand is 140 points behind. Required the oddsagainst the elder hand's winning the partie.

The odds given by the table are 9966 to 34,or 293 to I. The elder hand must get a repiqueand capot to win. In a few cases, the youngerhand may score a quatorze, when he may win, not-withstanding the elder hand's repique and capot.Making a full allowance for this contingency, theodds are about 290 to i.

(6). In less desperate cases, the calculation ofthe odds becomes rather more complicated, as theconsideration of the score made by the youngerhand has to be taken into account. Thus :-Itis required to find the odds that the elder handwill score 90 more than the younger.

This cannot be discovered from the tables; butit may be approximated to as follows :-

Including the cases in which the elder scoresbetween 90 and 100, the odds against him are

PIQUET. 207

about 24^ to 1. Excluding these cases, the oddsare about 25 to i. It may be concluded that theodds against the elder hand are nearer to 25 to ithan 24 to I.

As the odds against a rejoique are 27}^ to i,and as an elder hand repique does not necessarilyscore 90 more than the younger, it might be arguedthat the odds should be more than 25 to i. Butmore than 90 may be scored without a repique,as by pique and capot. And, on looking at thetable, it will be seen that the elder hand scoresover 100 more than eighteen times as often as hescores between 90 and 100. Hence it would seemthat the odds of 25 to i are not far from the mark.

(7). Required the odds that the younger handwill save the rubicon, he being 90, last hand ofa partie.

The odds are 6444 to 3556, or 9 to 5 in his favour.

(8). The younger hand wanting 20 to save therubicon, the odds against him are 6116 to 3884,or about 13 to 8.

NEGLECTED VARIATIONS.

The tables necessarily neglect variations which may arise in consequence of discarding and play-ing to the score, the great majority of the recordedhands having been played without reference tothese considerations, and all hands having beenomitted in which a player, finding his game hope-less, has played to divide the cards, or to scoreas little as possible.

2o8 PIQUET.

The odds found by the tables can only be re-garded as approximate odds, and as less than thetrue odds against a player who has to gain a pointfor which he especially strives. For instance:-The elder hand wanting 29 to get out, and seeingit on the cards to make that number, might dis-card, or play the cards, accordingly. On the otherhand, the odds may be more than the true oddsagainst a player v/ho has the partie well in hand,and who is only scheming to keep his adversaryback, as, e.g.^ when the elder hand sacrifices apique in order to win or to divide the cards.

ODDS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TABLES,.

It is about 5 to 3 on the elder hand for thecards; nearly 3 to i against the younger hand'swinning the cards; and a trifle over 7 to i againstthe cards being divided.

The odds against a rubicon are about 7 to 2.The odds against a named player being rubi-coned are, therefore, 8 to i.

A partie averages two hundred points.

The odds against a repique elder hand arenearly 27}^ to i; against a younger hand re-pique, about 75 to I.

The odds against a pique (which of course in-cludes a repique) are rather more than 7 to i(about 36 to 5).

The odds against a carte blanche in a namedplayer's hand are 1791 to i.
