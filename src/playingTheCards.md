# Playing the cards

## Counting the hand

In playing the cards, you must be guided good deal by what your adversary has called,and also, to some extent, by what he has not called (but see Sinking, pp. 156-165). You will generally know several cards in the adverse hand,or will be able to mark some that have been put out; sometimes you will know all the cards,especially after some of the tricks have been played. For instance : - If the younger hand fails to follow suit to your first lead of a suit of which you could only have five cards, it is evident he has put out three of that suit. You then know every card in his hand, and should regulate your play accordingly.

In default of actual knowledge of the contents of your opponent's hand, you should count his cards so far as he has called them, and should consider what cards he is least likely to have discarded. You then mentally assign to him the cards he has most probably kept, and so fill up his number (see Examples I. and II.).

## Habit of adversary

You should also take into account the personal habit of your adversary in discarding, calling, and playing.

For instance: Some players habitually make bold discards, and throw entire suits. These are often found unguarded. Others, on the contrary, are timid discarders. These are generally guarded, even elder hand. The timid discarder is apt to leave a card, or to put out one of his point, in order to keep himself guarded. In the latter case he may, if unguarded, have sunk a card; but timid players seldom sink anything, except in very pronounced cases.

The same division of players into bold and timid applies to their play of the cards. A timid player, for example, will never give away a chance if he can make sure of dividing the cards. Against such an adversary it would be useless to unguarded king in play (as in Examples III. and IV.), because, when he finds himself with five tricks and an ace in hand, he is certain to dash out the ace.

Some, again, always throw high cards when attacked in suits in which they are guarded, in order to induce the leader to continue the suit.Thus:-With queen, nine, eight, they will throw the nine to the ace. If a player, who habitually does this, plays the eight to the ace, you may conclude he has not got the nine, and that he is unguarded.

Your safe rule as to playing small cards, is not to have any rule, and to play them sometimes in their natural order, and sometimes not.

## Playing to obtain information

This presents itself in various forms. The following are two common instances.

You have ace, queen, nine, eight, seven of hearts. You decide to lead hearts, notwithstanding that your adversary has called kings, and may hold king, knave, ten of hearts.

You lead ace of hearts, to which the ten falls.

You should next lead a small heart, not the queen. You thus discover whether the knave of hearts is out.

If your adversary has not called kings, and it is possible that he has discarded a king, your second lead should be queen of hearts, as you may find the knave single against you.

Again: Several tricks have been played, and you are in doubt what to lead. You have a suit headed by ace, king. You would generally be right to lead the ace, in order to see one more card before determining on your subsequent tactics. This point of play is of more importance than at first sight appears. It will be incidentally noticed in the Examples.

Conversely, you should play so as to avoid giving information. Thus: When you have the choice of throwing a card you have called, or one you have not, you should prefer the former.

You have, e.g., king, queen, and a small one of a suit, and have called kings, but not queens.Ace is led, to which you play the small one.The suit is continued; you should next play the king.

## Establishing a suit

Failing direct indications from the calling, your first lead should be from a suit you are likely to establish, such as king, queen, knave, and a small card; ace, queen, knave, and a small card,and so on. It is obvious that, when you again have the lead, you should generally pursue the suit of which you have winning cards remaining.

With two suits of equal commanding strength, you should generally begin by leading the one of which you hold the greater number. (For an exception to this rule, see below)

## Preserving guards and tenaces

When throwing to the opponent's lead, you should, of course, keep guards to kings and queens. Exceptional hands occur in which these should be unguarded, owing to the score, or to other circumstances (see following Examples III. and IV.).

When towards the close of a hand you have a tenace in one suit, and winning cards with a losing card in others, you should lead the winning cards and then the losing card, to oblige your adversary to lead up to the tenace. Of course, if you can count that your adversary is unguarded in the tenace suit, the above rule does not apply.

Also, when holding a tenace, it is often advisable to keep a losing card of another suit of which the adversary has the best, in order to give him the lead at a time when he must lead up to your tenace.

When you hold two tenace suits of equal commanding strength, and must find your adversary unguarded in one of them in order to divide the cards, you should generally first lead the less numerous suit; and, if you must play to divide the cards (owing to the score), and your adversary is equally likely to be unguarded in either suit,you should always attack first in the one of which you hold the fewer number.

The management and preservation of tenaces is a very important, and often a difficult point, in the play of the cards. (See Examples V. to X).

## Playing to save a capot

When you are put to a card (i.e., when your adversary has won eleven tricks and you remain with two cards, and are in doubt which of them to keep), you should keep the card of the suit of which the greater number is against you.

For example: You remain with ace of spades and ace of hearts, and have to play one of them to a club or a diamond led. By counting all the cards played, and your discard, you find that there are three spades wanting, and two diamonds, in respect of which it is an even chance that any four may have been discarded. In that case,you should keep the ace of spades.

In making this calculation, you should include all the absent cards of each suit, without reference to the fact that one of them, which might have been reckoned in calling, has not been reckoned.For, should your adversary see he can put you to a card, he will certainly sink the combination which, if reckoned, would tell you what his twelfth card is.

An exception to this is when reckoning the score, previously assumed to be sunk, would give your adversary a pique or a repique. Then it would not be worth his while to sink a card on the chance of a capot.

## Playing to the score

If you have five, or six, tricks and a winning card and the lead, play the winning card, unless certain that your opponent holds that suit, either from what he has called, or from the cards he has already played; for, by playing otherwise, you risk eleven points for the chance of gaining one for the last card.

If, however, one trick does not make the difference of saving, or winning, the cards, and you remain, at the end of a hand, with a winning card and a losing card, you should generally lead the losing card, in order to win the last trick, unless you can tell that the adversary has none of the suit to which your winning card belongs. For instance: You remain with ace, queen of a suit,and the lead; and there is nothing in the previous call or play to show that your adversary does not hold the king guarded. The presumption, then,is that he has the king guarded, and you should lead the queen, in hopes of making the last trick.

These rules are liable to modification in consequence of the state of the score. For example:-Although the rule is to make sure of the cards,nevertheless, when one point saves the rubicon,or wins or saves the partie, you should risk the cards for the sake of the last trick. Again : If you are elder hand and have the best of the partie,and can ensure dividing the cards, you should never risk the loss of them; but, if the younger hand has the best of the partie, it is often to your interest, as elder, to risk the loss of the cards,if, by so doing, you obtain a chance of winning them.

For an instance of playing to divide the cards,see Example XL

It often happens that you have the option, when playing the cards, of making a certain number of tricks off the reel, and of letting your opponent score the remainder, or of changing the lead from your hand to his, and vice versa, one or more times. In either case, you win the same number of tricks; but every time you part with the lead and regain it, each player scores one point in play more than if the cards had been played without changing the lead. Whether you should make tricks straight off, or should play in and out, depends on the score.

If you are less than a hundred, and are not within your show {see p. 199), you should play in and out. If you are within your show, and your adversary is not, you should keep him back,by refraining from playing in and out.

If you and your adversary are both over a hundred, it is immaterial whether you play in and out or not. If you play in and out, for every extra point you score, your adversary does the same; so there is then no advantage to either side (see Examples XII. to XVL).

When you are near a pique, reckon up all the winning cards you have in hand, to ascertain whether you can make thirty before you lose the lead. If you can do so, lead your winning cards one after the other, without considering how many of the remaining tricks you will lose.

There is one exception to this rule, owing to the score. Suppose, in the sixth deal, the score is such that, if the younger hand wins the cards,he saves the rubicon. In this case, if the elder hand can win the partie without the pique, and can divide or win the cards by not leading his winning cards immediately, but would lose the cards by so doing, he should forego the pique in order to win a rubicon (see Example XVII.,p. 197).

It may also happen, but seldom, that similar tactics should be resorted to in the fifth hand,your adversary being very backward, and you very forward, in the score.

In the last deal of a partie, if your adversary has scored less than a hundred, your object should be to prevent his reaching a hundred, and at the same time to make him score as many as possible,provided you can stop him short of a hundred.You should endeavor to prevent his declaring equalities; and if you cannot win the cards yourself, you should try to compel him to win them.

If, on the other hand, you see you cannot reach a hundred, your object should be to score as little as possible, to declare equalities, and to divide the cards. If you see you cannot divide the cards, let your adversary add thirteen (for the tricks), and ten (for the cards), to his score. You thus avoid scoring by in and out play, and score nothing,it being understood that you are not piqued or capoted in consequence (see Example XIX.).

## Examples

In the following Examples both hands are shown, for the sake of convenience. But only one hand is known, viz., the one of which the discard is stated. All that is known of the adverse hand is what is derived from calling, or from cards already played, as assumed, for instance, in Examples XII., XIII., and XIV.

The score is assumed to be love-all, unless otherwise stated.

### Example I.

</div>
<p class="calibre5">B (Younger Hand).

B has discarded seven of spades; and eight,seven of diamonds.

A calls thirty-four for point, not good. Theonly four-card point, making four, that A canhold is in clubs (^see Table, p. 155).

PIQUET.

A leads the diamonds, to which B follows suit. Athen leads ace, queen of spades; B plays ten, king.

B should now lead ace and another heart, whenhe must at least divide the cards.

If instead of leading the heart he leads the tiercemajor in clubs, he loses the cards.

If B could not count four clubs in A's hand, hewould be right to attack in the tierce major suit.For this reason, and also because if B has a four-card point it will most probably be in clubs, Ashould have called thirty-one for point. In actualpractice, however, a four-card point is frequentlycalled under similar circumstances.

Example II.

Couniing the hand, a trio not having been called.

A (Elder Hand).</p>
<div class="calibre7">
<img alt="Picture #43" src="images/000006.jpg" class="calibre1" />
</div>
<p class="calibre5">B (Younger Hand).

PIQUET. 177

B has discarded eight, seven of spades; andseven of hearts.

A calls a point in hearts, a quint and threeknaves, all good. He leads ace, queen, knaveof spades.

A's score, in hand and play, is now twenty-six.He did not call three queens; and as these wouldhave given him a pique, it may be assumed he hasnot got them.

To the spades, led by A, B therefore throws tenof spades and two clubs.

A then leads a heart. B wins it, and attacksin diamonds. However A plays, B must dividethe cards.

On the other hand, if A had called three queens,B should have thrown the diamonds to the spades,and have attacked in clubs. He assigns the aceof diamonds to A as the card he is most likely tohave kept, in case he went out with, say, a quartin hearts and three knaves. Under these circum-stances it is more than probable that A has at leastone club out, when B, by attacking in clubs, will atleast divide the cards.

Experienced players may perhaps think thatExamples I. and II. are too elementary to beof much use. It is, however, by considerationssimilar to those here given, that even the bestplayers regulate their play in cases of greaterdifficulty. Beginners are recommended to ob-serve carefully the importance of counting thehands {see p. 166).

l8o PIQUET.

A leads four clubs, to which B plays threeclubs and a small heart.

A then leads king of hearts, won by B withthe ace.

B leads four spades. A plays nine, ten ofspades, and, without hesitation, eight, nine ofdiamonds, unguarding the king.

B then leads a heart. A makes two tricks inhearts, and divides the cards.

If it is B's habit to dash out an ace when hehas five tricks, in order to make certain of dividingthe cards, A's play is difficult.

A has probably asked whether three kings aregood; and, if B is attentive, he will most likelycount queen of hearts, and king, knave of dia-monds in A'S hand, and will therefore lead aheart. But if B is thoughtless, and does nottake the trouble to count the hands, he maylead ace of diamonds in pursuance of his usualtactics. The worse player B is, the less likelyis A's coup to succeed, and A must regulate hisplay accordingly.

Unguarding a king (and sometimes even aqueen) during the play, if done without hesi-tation, will more frequently succeed against ahigh-class player than against an indifferent one.Of course, loss of the cards should not be riskedby unguarding, unless the score renders it im-perative to attempt to win them. Even then,if opposed to a player who keeps the score inview, the coup will hardly ever come off.

B now leads ace of hearts, that the lead maynot be put into his hand again. He next leadsknave of spades, when he must make a trick indiamonds, and win the cards.

If B does not get rid of the ace of hearts, A,after leading the spades, will give B the lead witha heart, and B only divides the cards.

B has discarded nine, seven of spades; andnine of diamonds.

A calls four cards for point, not good; a quartmajor and a tierce to a knave, good; and threekings, not good .

B reckons five clubs for point; three aces, andthree queens.

A leads a quart major in spades; B plays twospades and two clubs.

A next leads knave of hearts. B wins withqueen, and leads ace, queen of clubs.

A wins the queen of clul;&gt;s, and leads ten ofhearts. B wins the heart, and, whatever he plays,must lose one trick in diamonds. Consequently,the cards are divided.

If B plays properly, he wins the cards. Afterwinning with the queen of hearts, he should leadace, king of hearts. Then, after leading ace, queenof clubs, he must be led up to in diamonds.

Of course, it is possible that A may hold a fourthheart, or a double guard to his king of clubs. Ineither of these cases, B can only divide the cards,however he plays.

The beginner at Piquet should keep theseExamples (V. and VI.) well before him. Gettingrid of winning cards in order to avoid subse-quent leads is frequently overlooked by those notthoroughly versed in the game.

There is also the complementary case of re-serving a losing card with which to place thelead, illustrated by Examples VII. and VIII. ,

PIQUET. 187

A has discarded nine, eight, seven of spades;and eight, seven of hearts.

B has called three queens.

If B has both queen of hearts and queenof clubs guarded, he must win the cards. Ashould therefore play to find in which suitB is unguarded. If he begins with theclub suit, of which he has five, and finds thequeen guarded, he cannot save the cards. Heshould therefore attack in the three-card suit ofhearts.

If the queen falls to the second trick, he leadsthe knave, and then any card except a club, anddivides the cards. If the queen of hearts doesnot fall to the second trick, he then attacks inclubs.

Similarly, A declares a six-card point, viz., ace,queen, and four small cards. B is guarded inthat suit, and holds ace, queen, ten, and two smallcards of a second suit, and ace, queen, ten onlyof a third. As soon as B obtains the lead, heshould play the ace of the suit of which he holdsonly three. If the adversary is guarded in thatsuit, he is probably unguarded in the other. Ifhe is found guarded, B then attacks in the otherin hopes of winning the cards. Should B beginwith the suit of which he holds five cards, andfind the adversary guarded, he has no chance ofthe cards, but he has a chance by playing asdirected. If A is guarded in both suits B mustlose the cards.

A calls a six-card point in clubs, a tierce majorin spades, and four kings. His hand is known,therefore, all but one card, and either the kingof hearts or of diamonds must be unguarded.

A leads tierce major in spades. B plays twospades and eight of hearts. He must not partwith his nine of clubs.

A now leads king of clubs, which B wins.

B should lead the ace of diamonds, becauseit is his less numerous suit. If the king falls,he continues the diamonds, and then leads nineof clubs, and divides the cards.

PIQUET.

189

If the king of diamonds does not fall to theace, B next leads hearts, and divides the cards.

If B leads ace of hearts, before the diamond,and finds the king guarded, he loses the cards;but if he finds the king of hearts unguarded, hewins the cards. B's play may therefore dependon the score. If winning the cards wins thepartie, or saves the rubicon, B should risk theheart; if dividing the cards wins the partie, Bshould lead the diamond. Or, if B is consider-ably behind in the score, and winning the cardsbrings him within his show, he should generallylead the heart {see Example XL).

190 PIQUET.

B has discarded knave, ten of clubs-; and tenof diamonds.

A declares five diamonds, and leads the king.B wins the trick.

The probability is that A has gone for diamondsand queens. It is not at all unlikely that he hasqueen of spades or queen of hearts single.

B therefore leads ace of spades. A plays theeight. B still makes an effort to win the cards,and leads a'ce of hearts, to which A plays the seven.

B is quite in the dark as to the remainingspades and hearts in A's hand. As it happens,if B pursues the attack in hearts, he loses thecards. On the other hand, if A has guards inspades instead of in hearts, and B continues toattack in spades, he also loses the cards.

Under these circumstances, B can make certainof dividing the cards by now leading king of clubs.If the score is such that he must play to win thecards, he has no alternative but to continue hisattack at random in one or other of his ace, kingsuits.

Example XII.In and out play.

The last three cards in the leader's hand areking, queen, ten of a suit, of which he can countthe adversary with ace, knave, and a small one.

The leader makes certain of three points in playby leading the ten. If he leads king or queen,

PIQUET. 191

he only scores two, should his adversary refuseto win the card first led.

In one case, the score in play is A, two; B, three.In the other, it is A, three; B, four.

A's proper lead depends on the score {seepp. 172, 173).

Again:-A has tierce major, and two smallspades; and, king, queen of diamonds.

B has called four knaves and three aces.

A leads four of his spades. If knave of dia-monds remains in B's hand, A makes seven inplay by next leading a diamond. But, if A leadsthe fifth spade, and knave of diamonds is thrownto it, he only scores six in play.

Example XIII.In and out play.

A has, declared in his hand, ace, queen, knaveof spades; and king, ten of hearts.

B holds, ace, queen, knave of hearts; and king,ten of spades.

It is the last hand of the partie. A, who isninety-five, leads the ace of spades, which makeshis total score ninety-six. A has already won threetricks (excluding the ace of spades), and B four.

If B throws the king of spades to the ace, Acan only score to ninety-nine.

If B throws the ten to the ace, each playermakes one more point in play.

The card for B to play to the ace depends onthe score Thus:-If B requires four points to

192 PIQUET.

save the rubicon, he should play the ten tothe ace.

Example XIV.In and out play.

A has, declared in his hand, ace, queen, knaveof spades; ten of hearts; ace, nine of clubs.

B holds, king, ten of spades; knave, nine ofhearts; king, queen of clubs.

A can count B's hand, and knows him to besingly guarded in both spades and clubs.

If A leads ace, queen of spades, he will scorefive in play, and B will score four.

The result will be the same if A leads ace, nineof clubs.

If A leads ten of hearts, he scores six in play,and B five. The number of tricks won by Awill be the same in either case, viz., three.

After what has already been said, it will beclear that A's lead depends on the score.

Say it is the fifth hand of the partie, andthat A is under a rubicon. He should leadthe heart.

Or, to take an extreme case, it is the last hand,and A's score (including what he has alreadymade in the hand) is ninety-four. If he doesnot lead the heart, he is rubiconed.

On the other hand, if A is well ahead, andhis game is to keep B back, he should not leadthe heart.

A leads seven of hearts; B plays the nine.If, instead of the seven, A leads ace, king ofhearts, as he probably would in an ordinaryhand, he cannot reckon thirteen in play.

B leads anything-say, queen of hearts. Awins with the king, and leads ace, eight of hearts.It is compulsory on A to lead eight of heartsafter the ace.

B wins the eight of hearts, and next leads aclub, which A wins.

If B now leads a spade, A wins it, returns thespade, and then leads queen of diamonds. Or,if, instead of a spade, B leads a diamond, A winsit, and leads ace, queen of spades, and makes thelast trick with a diamond.

The reason A leads seven of spades, at the

o 2

sixth trick, instead of going on with the clubsuit, IS now apparent. Suppose all the heartsand clubs played, and that A remains with ace,queen, seven of spades, and ace, queen of dia-monds. B has king, knave, ten of spades, andking, knave of diamonds, and it is B's lead. Bleads a diamond, won by A. A leads seven ofspades, won by B, who again leads a diamond,won by A.

Now A remains with ace, queen of spades, andis in a dilemma. He cannot tell whether B hastwo spades left, or a spade and a diamond. Ifthen A leads ace of spades, on the speculationthat B has one spade and one diamond (theprobable case), he fails to score thirteen in play.By leading the seven of spades at an earlier periodof the hand, as directed, A avoids being thus putto a lead.

At some scores, A's play would be very bad.As played, A reckons thirteen and B ten. Byleading three aces and two kings, and any othercard (keeping ace, queen of diamonds), A makesthe same number of tricks, but the scores in playare. A, nine; B, six; a difference of four to eachplayer. Suppose then B were ninety-three aftercounting his hand, and A any higher score, Ashould not play in and out.

Or, suppose it is the fifth hand of the partie,and that A can reach the score of eighty-six,by playing in and out. He should play to getwithin his show {see p. 173).

It is the last hand of the partie. A has dis-carded knave, eight, seven of clubs; and ten,eight of diamonds.

A's score is seventy; B's score is eighty-two.

A has a pique, good against the cards, if, afterreckoning his point, quint, and three aces, heleads his aces and kings, and then any othercard.

If A plays in this way, he scores sixty, andhis total score is a hundred and thirty. B scoreseight in play, and ten for the cards, and his total

score is a hundred. B saves the rubicon, andA wins a partie of a hundred and thirty.

But, if A foregoes the pique, and leads aceand another heart, he must divide the cards, what-ever B has discarded. A then wins a rubicon.

Played in this way, with the hands given above,A scores twenty-four in hand, two in play (for ace,queen of hearts), and six for the last five tricks(in all thirty-two), and the cards are divided.

B scores seven in play (this he must reckonin order to divide the cards).

The scores will then be, A, a hundred and two;B, eighty-nine. A wins a rubicon of two hundredand ninety-one.

By foregoing the pique, A gains a hundred andsixty-one points.

In order to avoid complicating the case withother considerations, the question of A's bestplay has hitherto been neglected. It will beseen that A can still make sure of dividing thecards if he leads the ace of spades before at-tacking in hearts. And, he may find B un-guarded in spades. In that event, he wins apique and the cards. If the queen of spadesdoes not fall to the ace, A should then changeto the heart suit, leading ace and queen as aboveadvised. In other words, A should not thought-lessly throw away a chance of a pique, becausehe sees he can certainly win a rubicon by fore-going it.

It is the sixth hand of the partie. The scoresare, A, forty-three; B, ninety.

A has discarded eight, seven of spades; ten,seven of hearts; and nine of diamonds.

If A's point of thirty-nine in clubs is good, Bmust be out in spades, and A scores a repique.

If B is out in spades, A can equally win arepique by calling a point of thirty-eight in dia-monds. In either case B is rubiconed.

200 PIQUET.

On the other hand, if B has his quart inspades, there is no repique. A's resource, then,is a capot, and this he can win if B is unguardedin clubs.

But A may possibly capot his adversary, evenif guarded in clubs, by inducing him to believethat clubs are out, elder hand. If A calls thirty-nine for point, it is evident that the point is inclubs, and B will keep himself guarded in thatsuit. A's object, therefore, should be to concealthe fact that he holds four clubs, and A shouldcall thirty-eight in diamonds- It has already beenshown that, if B has four spades, this call can onlyinjure A to the extent of four points, a matter notworth considering as against the chance of a capot.

B replies, "Not good." He therefore has aquart in spades.

A, in pursuance of his tactics, calls four kingsand three aces (not reckoning the ace of clubs),

A leads his four diamonds. To three of thediamonds B plays nine of spades, eight of hearts,and seven of clubs. B has now to play one othercard. If he believes the ace of clubs to be out,he will naturally throw the nine of clubs. If hedoes so, he is capoted.

The scores will then be:-A, seventeen in hand,thirteen in play, and forty for the cards and capot;total, seventy. This, added to his former score offorty-three, makes him a hundred and thirteen.B scores eight, making him ninety-eight. A winsa rubicon of three hundred and eleven.

It is the sixth hand of the partie. A has dis-carded nine, eight of hearts; and queen, nine,eight of clubs.

B's score is fifty.

A's first care should be to see whether B canpossibly make fifty, which saves the rubicon.Whatever he has discarded, he cannot score morethan forty-seven.

If A calls, '"Forty-eight" in diamonds, B willreply, "Equal," and will declare forty-eight inhearts, his object being to declare equalities. A

should call twenty-nine for point, which compelsa score. B should allow this to be good.

A should then call a quart to a knave. Bshould say, "Not good," as, if he admits it,A also reckons a tierce in diamonds.

A then calls three tens, which B, in order toconceal his hand, allows to be good.

A leads ace of clubs, that he may not riskbeing put to a card; and, as he cannot win thecards, should try to lose them. A next leads kingof diamonds.

It is now B's turn. He has discarded sevenof spades; knave of clubs; and nine of diamonds.In order to reckon as little as possible, he onlycalls a quart in hearts.

B wins A's diamond; and, if he plays properly,can divide the cards.

B leads tierce major in spades, four tricks; ace,king of hearts, six tricks. To the hearts A playsking of clubs and ten of diamonds, endeavouringto lose the cards if B holds knave of clubs or nineof diamonds.

B now leads seven of diamonds. A wins it•with the knave; and, as he has only winningcards in his hand, the cards are divided.

If A had continued with a second club afterthe ace, B should have thrown the ten of hearts,as seven of hearts and seven of diamonds, if keptin hand, may enable B, after winning six tricks,to get rid of the lead when A remains with onlywinninLT cards.
