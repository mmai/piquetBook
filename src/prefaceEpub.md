**_The laws of Piquet adopted by the Portland and Turf Clubs_ with _A Treatise on the Game_ by Cavendish author of _The Laws and principle of whist_ etc., etc.**

# Preface to the epub edition

This is a transcription of the 8th edition of the book _Cavendish on Piquet_.

There is one difference with the original : I chose to postpone the _Laws of Piquet_ part at the end of the book, as it is mainly reference material and is therefore poorly suited to serve as an introduction to the game of Piquet.

# Preface to the first edition

Since Hoyle's Treatise on Piquet was published in 1744, no original work on Piquet has appeared in the English language (so far as the author has been able to discover), though Hoyle has several times been edited with more or less success.

The issue of an authorized code of Laws affords a good occasion for the publication of afresh treatise on the game. Although the plan of it is original, the author has made free use of the examples contained in Hoyle's valuable work.The author has also (through the great kindness of Mr. Clay,) been able to avail himself of that accomplished player's judgment and experience. For the assistance rendered to him by Mr. Clay, the author takes this opportunity of expressing his warmest thanks.

Portland Club, May, 1873.
