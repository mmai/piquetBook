                <h1 id="laws-of-piquet">LAWS OF PIQUET</h1>
<h2 id="shuffling">SHUFFLING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each player has a right to shuffle both his own and his adversary's pack. The dealer has the right of shuffling last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pack must not be shuffled below the table, nor in such manner as to expose the faces of any of the cards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cutting">CUTTING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A cut must consist of at least two cards, and at least two must be left in the lower packet,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cutting, the ace is highest. The player who cuts the higher card has the choice of deal, and the dealer has the choice of cards at the commencement of each partie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, in cutting for deal, a player expose more than one card, he must cut again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cut for the deal holds good, even if the pack be incorrect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, in cutting to the dealer, or in reuniting the separated packets, a card be exposed, or if there be any confusion of the cards, there must be a fresh cut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a player in cutting has once separated the pack, he must abide by the cut.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dealing">DEALING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The dealer must deal the cards by two at a time or by three at a time, giving the top cards to his adversary, the next to himself, and so on, until each player has twelve cards. The dealer having selected the mode in which he will distribute the cards, must not change it during the partie. The eight undealt cards (called the stock) are to be placed face downward, in one packet, on the table between the players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the dealer deal the cards wrongly, he may, with the permission of his adversary, rectify the error prior to either player having taken up his hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand find that he has a card too many or a card too few, he has the option of a fresh deal after looking at his hand, but before taking up a card of the stock. If the elder hand, having twelve cards dealt him,' find,in drawing the stock toward him after discarding,that it contains but seven cards, he has the option of a fresh deal, or of altering his discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one card be dealt wrongly, or if there be nine cards in the stock, there must be a fresh deal (except as provided in Law 10).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the dealer expose a card belonging to his adversary, or to the stock, the elder hand has the option of a fresh deal. If the dealer expose any of his own cards, the deal stands good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a faced card be found in the pack when dealing, or in the stock when taking in, there must be a fresh deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the dealer deal with the wrong pack, and the error be discovered before either player has taken up any of his cards, there must be a fresh deal with the right pack. If the error be not discovered before either player has taken up any of his cards, the deal holds good, and the packs remain changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The players deal alternately. If a player deal out of his turn, and either player discover the error before taking up any of his cards, the deal in error is void, and the right dealer deals.But if the error be discovered too late to correct it, the elder hand in that deal must deal twice running with the same pack (except as provided in Law 76), unless that or the next deal be the last of the partie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The non dealer must collect the cards for the ensuing deal, and must place them, properly collected, face downward on the table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="carte-blanche">CARTE BLANCHE</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Carte blanche</em> (a hand dealt, consisting of at least twelve cards, without king, queen, or knave) scores first, and consequently saves a <em>pique</em> or a <em>repique</em>. It also counts toward a <em>pique</em> or a <em>repique</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Carte blanche</em> must be shown by counting the cards, one by one, face upward on the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as a player is aware that he has a carte blanche, he is bound to inform his adversary, but he need not show the <em>carte blanche</em> until his adversary has discarded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="discarding-and-taking-in">DISCARDING AND TAKING IN</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The elder hand is entitled to discard five cards and to take in five. He is obliged to discard one card (except as provided in Law 42).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The younger hand is entitled to discard three cards, and to take in three (except as provided in Laws 41 and 43). He is obliged to discard one card (except as provided in Law 40).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In taking in, the cards must be taken in order from the top of the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a player has taken up a card of the stock he cannot alter his discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player, after having taken up a card of the stock, take back into his hand any of his discard, he must play with more than twelve cards, and can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player, after having taken up a card of the stock, mix any of his hand, or any card he is entitled to take in, with his discard, he must leave it with his discard. He must play with less than twelve cards, and his adversary counts as tricks all cards that cannot be played to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand, when taking in, or when looking at cards he has left, expose or take up any of the bottom three cards of the stock (except as provided in Laws 41 and 43), he can reckon nothing that deal. And similarly, if the younger hand, when taking in, expose or take up any of the top five cards of the stock (not being cards declared to be left by the elder hand), he can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand mix with his hand any of the bottom three cards of the stock (exceptas provided in Laws 41 and 43), or if, having left any cards, he mix with his hand any of the cards he ought to have left, he can reckon nothing that deal; or, the younger hand, after looking a this cards, may elect to have a fresh deal. If he elect to stand the deal, he can only take as many of his cards as have not been mixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the younger hand mix with his hand any of the top five cards of the stock (not being cards declared to be left by the elder hand), he can reckon nothing that deal; or, the elder hand, after looking at his cards, may elect to have afresh deal. If he elect to stand the deal, he can only take as many of his cards as have not been mixed. If, however, the elder hand have taken in some of his cards, the others remaining on the stock, and the younger hand take up any of them,he incurs no penalty, unless he mix any of the cards taken up with his hand, when he can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player, having twelve cards dealt him, discard more cards than he takes in, he must play with less than twelve cards, and his adversary counts as tricks all cards that cannot be played to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player, having twelve cards dealt him,take in more cards than he discards, but do not take from the stock one of his adversary's cards,he must play with more than twelve cards, and can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand do not take all his cards,he must declare the number he takes or leaves before taking up a card of the stock. If he fail to do so, and the younger hand, on touching the stock (but before taking up a card of it),find that it contains more than three cards, he is entitled to alter his discard, and to take in the card or cards left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand leave any cards, he is entitled to look at them; but if he take them up, together with the cards he is about to take in, he can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The younger hand is entitled to take in all the cards that are left in the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the younger hand leave any cards, and take up, together with the cards he is about to take in, more cards than he has discarded, he can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the younger hand leave any cards he is entitled to see them; but he must declare whether he will look at them or not, after the elder hand has named the suit he will first lead, or has led a card, and before laying a card himself. If the younger hand elect to look at them, the elder hand is also entitled to see them, after he has named the suit he will first lead, or has led a card. If the younger hand elect not to look at them, neither player has a right to see them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the younger hand leave any cards, and mix them with his discard without showing them to the elder hand, the elder hand, after leading a card, is entitled to see his adversary's discard,and the cards mixed with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player announce that he has eleven or thirteen cards dealt him, the stock may be counted to ascertain how many cards it contains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand, having eleven or thirteen cards dealt him, take up a card of the stock without announcing the error, he loses his option of a fresh deal. He cannot alter his discard,and he must leave at least three cards for the younger hand. But, if the stock contain seven cards, and the elder hand have eleven, there must be a fresh deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has thirteen cards, and there are eight in the stock, he must discard one card more than he takes in, and he must discard at least two cards. The younger hand must discard one less than he takes in; but, if he only take one card, he need not discard any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has thirteen cards, and there are seven in the stock, he must discard one more card than he takes in. He must discard at least two cards;and, if he take all his cards, he discards six, and the younger hand can only take two cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has eleven cards, and there are eight in the stock, he must discard one less than he takes in; but, if he only take one card, he need not discard any. The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, and he must discard at least two cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has twelve cards, and there are seven in the stock, he must discard the same number of cards as he takes in; and, if he take all his cards, the younger hand can only take two cards.The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, and he must discard at least two cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a player subjects himself to the penalty of reckoning nothing that deal, the adversary has the option of not enforcing the penalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player may examine his own discard at any time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="calling-and-showing">CALLING AND SHOWING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The elder hand must call his point first, or he loses the right to call it. It is sufficient to call the number of cards of the point. The younger hand is not entitled to reply by inquiring what the elder hand's point makes, unless he hold at least an equal number of cards; and the inquiry bars him from counting a superior number of cards for point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not compulsory on the younger hand to call his point first; nor is it compulsory on either player to call sequence next after point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is sufficient to call the number of cards of a sequence if the call be good against the cards. If not good against the cards, the elder hand is bound to state to what card his sequence is. And similarly, in calling a <em>quatorze</em> or <em>trio</em>,the elder hand is bound to state the value of the cards of which it consists, unless the call is good against the cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand first call a sequence which is good against the cards, he can reckon any sequences he holds, whether of superior counting value to the one called or not. And similarly, if the elder hand first call a <em>trio</em> or a <em>quatorze</em> which is good against the cards, he can reckon any <em>quatorzes</em> or <em>trios</em> that he holds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the elder hand call a smaller point, sequence, quatorze or trio than he holds, he may correct his miscall before it has been replied to by the younger hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the younger hand allow a correct call to be good or equal, when he holds better in his hand, he may correct his reply before the elder hand has made another call; or, in case there is no further call, before the elder hand has led a card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If either player call a larger point, sequence, <em>quatorze</em>, or <em>trio</em> than he holds, and it is allowed to be good, he may correct his miscall before the younger hand has played to the first trick.In case of a correction of such miscall by the younger hand, after the elder hand has led, the elder hand is at liberty to retake the card he led, and to play differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no penalty for a misnomer. It is a misnomer, if a player call a point or sequence, when he holds one of that counting value, but names the suit wrongly; or a sequence, when he holds one of that counting value, but names its rank wrongly ; or a trio or quatorze, when he holds one, but hames its rank wrongly ; provided, however, that he could not possibly have held what he claims, in his hand and discard taken together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player who calls a point, sequence, quatorze, or trio that he does not hold, and such call is allowed to be good, do not correct his miscall before the younger hand has played to the first trick, he can reckon nothing that deal, except in the case of a misnomer, or of his having called anything which he could not possibly have held in his hand and discard taken together, when he is liable to no penalty. On discovery of the error, the adversary may reckon anything he has good, which is not barred by a correct call of the player in error, made in addition to his miscall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player who calls anything which is allowed to be good or equal, must show the cards called at any time they are asked for, orin the case of the younger hand, at any time after the elder hand has led a card. If a player,before he plays a card, voluntarily show anything which he claims to be good or equal, he is liable to no penalty for miscalling what he has shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the younger hand has played to the first trick, neither player can reckon anything omitted (except as provided in Law 54).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing">PLAYING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a player play with less than twelve cards in hand, he is liable to no penalty. His adversary counts as tricks all cards that cannot be played to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player play with more than twelve cards in hand, he can reckon nothing that deal;but his cards, though not good to score, are good to bar his adversary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A card once led or played cannot betaken up, except as provided in Law 52, and as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I. If a player accidentally drop a card or cards, he may retake them.</p>
</li>
<li>II. If the leader lead two or more cards consecutively without waiting for his adversary to play, and the adversary plays too many cards, he may, on discovery of the error, retake the extra card or cards. All cards subsequently played in error must be taken up and played over again.</li>
<li>III. If a player lead out of turn, the card led may be taken up, unless the adversary have played to the trick, when the error cannot be rectified. </li>
<li>IV. If a player do not follow suit when able,he must; when the error is detected,retake any cards played in error, and substitute the suit led. The players also retake all cards played after the mistake,and the play of the remainder of the cards then proceeds as though no error had been committed.</li>
<li>
<p>V. If a player, when asked what cards he has in hand which have been allowed to be good or equal, misinform his adversary, the adversary may retake all cards played subsequently to the misinformation, and play differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player is entitled to examine both hi sown and his adversary's tricks at any time.</p>

<h2 id="scoring">SCORING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Carte blanche scores ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The largest point is good. The point, when good, scores one for each card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The longest sequence is good; as between sequences of equal length the highest is good. Sequences, when good, score as follows : a huitième scores eighteen; a septième, seventeen; a sixième, sixteen; a quint, fifteen; a quart, four; a tierce, three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The highest <em>quatorze</em> is good. Any <em>quatorze</em> is good against a <em>trio</em>. As between <em>trios</em>, the highest <em>trio</em> is good. A <em>quatorze</em>, when good, scores fourteen. A <em>trio</em>, when good, scores three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In playing the cards, each player scores one for every card he leads, or with which he wins a trick. The winner of the last trick scores two instead of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player who wins more than six tricks scores ten for the cards. If each player win six tricks the cards are divided, and there is no score for them. A player who wins twelve tricks wins a <em>capot</em>, and scores forty for the cards instead of ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scores, whether obtained by the elder or younger hand, reckon in the following order :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I. Carte blanche.</p>
</li>
<li>II. Point.</li>
<li>III. Sequences.</li>
<li>IV. Quatorzes and trios.</li>
<li>V. Points made in play.</li>
<li>
<p>VI. The cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>repique</em> is obtained on the score of thirty being made by a player, in his hand alone, by scores that reckon in order before anything that his adversary can count. A player obtaining a <em>repique</em> adds sixty to his score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>pique</em> is obtained on the score of thirty being made by the elder hand, in hand and play, before his adversary has reckoned anything that deal. A player obtaining a <em>pique</em> adds thirty to his score. A <em>capot</em> reckons after points made in play; and, therefore, does not count toward a <em>pique</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors in counting the hand, if proved, maybe rectified at any time before the player in error has seen his next hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A partie consists of six deals. The partie is won by the player who makes the higher score in six deals. If both players score the same number in six deals, each deals once more, when the partie is concluded, even if there should be a second tie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em> By agreement, a partie may consist of four deals, the score in the first and last deals counting double. In case of a tie, each deals once more, the scores in the extra deals counting single.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The winner of the partie deducts the score of the loser from his own; and the difference, with a hundred added, is the number of points won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the loser fail to score a hundred, the winner, whether his score reach a hundred or not, adds the score of the loser to his own; and the sum, with a hundred added, is the number of points won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of a difference in the written scores, a player's score of his own hand shall be taken as correct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="incorrect-packs">INCORRECT PACKS</h2>
<ol>
<li>If a pack be discovered to be incorrect, redundant, or imperfect, the deal in which the discovery is made is void. All preceding deals stand good.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="changing-cards">CHANGING CARDS</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before the pack is cut to the dealer a player may call for fresh cards at his own expense. He must call for two new packs, of which the dealer has the choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Torn or marked cards must be replaced, or new packs called for at the expense of the two players.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bystanders">BYSTANDERS</h2>
<ol>
<li>If a bystander call attention to any error or oversight, and thereby affect the score, he maybe called on to pay all stakes and bets of the player whose interest he has prejudicially affected.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="laws-of-piquet-au-cent">LAWS OF PIQUET AU CENT</h1>
<p>The Laws of Piquet au cent, differ from those of Piquet in the following particulars: The player who cuts the lower card has to deal. If he exposes more than one card in cutting, his adversary may treat the lowest of the exposed cards as the one cut.</p>
<p>The deal is by two cards at a time.</p>
<p>If the elder hand find that he has a card too many or too few, he has the option of a fresh deal before touching the stock.</p>
<p>If the dealer deal with the wrong pack, and the error be discovered before the deal is completed, there must be a fresh deal with the right pack. If not discovered before the deal is completed, the deal holds good.</p>
<p>If a player deal out of his turn, and discover his error before taking up his hand, the deal in error is void, and the right dealer deals. If not discovered before taking up the hand, there is no remedy.</p>
<p>If the younger hand have a carte blanche, he need not declare it until his adversary has discarded and touched the stock.</p>
<p>The younger hand is not obliged to discard any card.</p>
<p>After a player has touched the stock he cannot alter his discard (except as provided in Laws of Piquet 11, 32, and 38).</p>
<p>If the elder hand mix with his hand one of the three bottom cards of the stock, he loses the game ; and, similarly, if the elder hand, having left a card or cards, mix with his hand any of the cards he ought to have left, he loses the game.</p>
<p>If the younger hand take up any of the top five cards of the stock (not being cards declared to be left by the elder hand), he loses the game.</p>
<p>If the elder hand do not take all his cards,he must declare the number he takes or leaves before touching the stock.</p>
<p>If the younger hand leave any cards and elect not to look at them, and either player should then look at them, they must be exposed, and a suit may be called from the offender when next he has to lead.</p>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has thirteen cards, he must discard one more card than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any. He must leave at least three cards for the younger hand.</p>
<p>If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has eleven cards and there are eight in the stock, he must discard one less than he takes in, and he must discard one card. The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any. If the elder hand elect to stand the deal when he has twelve cards and there are seven in the stock, he must leave at least three cards for the younger hand. The younger hand must discard one more than he takes in, but he is not obliged to take in any.</p>
<p>The elder hand must call the number his point makes. It is not sufficient to call the number of cards of the point.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to call the number of cards of a sequence. The elder hand must state to what card his sequence is. And, similarly, if he calls a <em>quatorze</em> or <em>trio</em>, he is bound to state the value of the cards of which it consists.</p>
<p>If the elder hand call a smaller point, sequence, quatorze or trio than he holds, or a trio when he holds a quatorze, he must abide by his call, and he cannot reckon anything superior, even though his call is good against the cards. He may,however, correct a misnomer of sequence, trio,or quatorze, before he leads a card, and may reckon anything of equal or inferior counting value, provided his call in error was good against the cards.</p>
<p>The elder hand having called anything which is good or equal must show the cards called,except in the case of quatorzes and trios. If he lead a card without showing his call, he cannot reckon it, and the adversary may show and reckon his point or sequence, even though it be equal or inferior to the one called.</p>
<p>If the elder hand show a sequence and call an inferior one, he cannot reckon the superior one; but the show bars the younger hand from reckoning his sequences, if only equal or inferior to the one shown.</p>
<p>The younger hand having allowed a correct call to be good or equal, must abide by his answer.</p>
<p>If the younger hand disallow a call, and it be discovered that the call of the elder hand is good or equal, the elder hand can show and reckon his superiority, or show his equality, notwithstanding that he has led a card.</p>
<p>If the younger hand say equal or not good to a call, and play to the first trick without showing his superiority or equality, the elder may show and reckon what he has called, notwithstanding that he has led a card.</p>
<p>If a player call a quatorze or trio which he does not hold, and it is allowed to be good,and he play a card without correcting the miscall, he can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
<p>When the elder hand has led a card, or the younger hand played to a trick, they cannot reckon anything omitted.</p>
<p>By agreement, points ending in four count one less than the number of cards.</p>
<p>By agreement, in playing the cards, nines,eights, and sevens are not counting cards.</p>
<p>Errors in adding up, or in marking the score,if proved, may be rectified at any time during the game.</p>
<p>A game is one hundred up. A player scoring a hundred before his adversary has scored fifty wins a double game.</p>
<p>A partie is won by a player who wins three games out of five, a double counting as two games.</p>
<p>A player has no choice of cards on commencing a fresh partie.</p>
<h1 id="cases-and-decisions">CASES AND DECISIONS.</h1>
<h2 id="case-i">Case I.</h2>
<ul>
<li>A calls four cards for point.</li>
<li>B replies, " Equal."</li>
<li>A says, " Forty-one."</li>
<li>B then finds he cannot have a point of forty-one, but that he has a point of five cards.</li>
<li>A claims to score the point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> </p>
<p>A cannot score the point. He has not made another call or a further call (Law 51); he has only completed an imperfect call.</p>
<p>B's reply bars him from counting a superior number of cards for point (Law 46). His point, though not good to score, is good to save a <em>pique</em> or a <em>repique</em>.</p>
<h2 id="case-ii">Case II</h2>
<p>A calls three kings, which B allows to be good. It is presently discovered that A has not three kings. B then claims to reckon four tens. Is he entitled to do so ?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong></p>
<p>B's admission of three kings being good is subject to A's holding them. B, it is true, might at once have disallowed the call; but, when he supposes A to have three kings, he may desire to sink his tens, and this he may no longer wish to do if he knows A to have a king out.</p>
<h2 id="case-iii">Case III</h2>
<p>A proposes a fresh deal.</p>
<p>B makes no reply until after A has discarded, when he says he will give a fresh deal.</p>
<p>A, judging from B's hesitation that there is not a powerful hand against him, states that he does not now wish for a fresh deal. B insists that as he has never refused the offer, it is still open,</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> : </p>
<p>The law does not contemplate the offer of a fresh deal. A fresh deal is a matter of agreement between the players. In this case, though B has not, in words, refused a fresh deal, he has allowed A to carry the game a step further by discarding. This is tantamount to a refusal.</p>
<h2 id="case-iv">Case IV</h2>
<p>A calls a point headed by ace, and two tierce majors in other suits, and leads a card, but says nothing about aces. Can B reckon three knaves ?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong></p>
<p>B cannot reckon three knaves. A has declared three aces by implication, and can reckon anything he has omitted before B plays to the first trick (Law 56). B's course is to play a card, saying nothing about knaves, when A loses the score for the aces.</p>
<p>If, however, A is under a rubicon, and B calls knaves, if A objects he must reckon his aces.</p>
<h2 id="case-v">Case V</h2>
<p>Elder hand directs the younger to discard for <em>carte blanche</em>. The younger having discarded three cards, the elder then shows his hand, and says, "I leave a card." Can the younger hand alter his discard after having seen his adversary's cards ?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> : Yes. The elder hand should state that he leaves a card before showing his <em>carte blanche</em>.</p>
<h2 id="case-vi">Case VI</h2>
<p>Elder hand discards, and takes up a card of the stock (Law 24).</p>
<p>Younger hand then finds he has a carte blanche, and proposes to show it (Law 19).</p>
<p>Can the elder hand alter his discard, as he has not been informed of the carte blanche? (Law 20.)</p>
<p>If not, can the younger hand reckon the <em>carte blanche</em>, as he has not informed the elder hand intime for him to discard for a carte blanche ?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> : The elder hand cannot alter his discard. The younger hand can reckon the <em>carte blanche</em>.</p>
<p>Note : This is a matter of etiquette rather than of law. The younger hand is bound to inform the elder as soon as he is aware he has a carte blanche (Law 20). If he is not aware that he has a <em>carte blanche</em> before the elder has taken up a card of the stock, there is no help for it.</p>
<p>The younger hand cannot be required to do an impossibility. Of course, bona fides is assumed on the part of the younger hand, i.e. that he has not unnecessarily delayed his declaration.</p>
<p>The old law was that the younger hand need not inform the elder of a carte blanche. The distinction between the duties of the elder and younger hands in this respect, was no doubt drawn in order to preclude the occurrence of such a case as the present.</p>
<h2 id="case-vii">Case VII</h2>
<p>A calls three queens. B says. "Which queen do you not reckon ?" A replies, " Queen of diamonds," and then reckons queens. B says,"Three queens are not good; I have three kings."Is B entitled to score his kings?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> No. Asking which queen is out is equivalent to admitting three queens to be good. B, by ascertaining which queen is out, obtains information to which he is only entitled in the case of A's scoring the queens.</p>
<h2 id="case-viii">Case VIII</h2>
<p>A calls three kings. B says, "Good. Whichking do you not reckon?" A replies, "King of diamonds." On playing the cards it is discovered that A has the king of diamonds in hand, and that he has put out the king of hearts.</p>
<p>B claims that A can score nothing that hand. A contends that it is only a misnomer, for which he cannot be punished.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B's claim is correct. It is true that A actually held three kings; but, as the reply of the elder hand is only a substitute for showing the kings, he has defined his claim to be for three kings, including one which he has not got. He is therefore liable to the penalty for scoring what he does not hold.</p>
<h2 id="case-ix">Case IX</h2>
<p>A calls four knaves (holding only three). B replies, "Good." A then says, "I beg your pardon, I have only three knaves." B replies "Not good." B might have held four aces, but,having discarded an ace, has only three.</p>
<p>A thus discovers before he leads a card that B has an ace out, and so obtains information to which he is not entitled. Has B any remedy?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B has no remedy. It is one of those accidents that will occasionally happen which card laws cannot reach.</p>
<h2 id="case-x">Case X</h2>
<p>A (elder hand) has a quint major, and such other cards that he will probably put B to a card.A places the quint major on the table and says " Play five cards."</p>
<p>B accidentally plays six cards.</p>
<p>At the end of the hand, when A plays his last card, it is found that B has no card to play to it.</p>
<p>B claims to play the hand over again (Law 59,par. II.)</p>
<p>A urges that B was distinctly informed how many cards he had to play; that he cannot benefit by his own mistake; and that, now he has seen all the cards, he knows which card to keep in order to save the <em>capot</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> The hand must be played over again, B retaking one of the cards he played to the quint major.</p>
<p>A might have protected himself by counting the cards originally played by B. If he is too careless to do so, he must take the consequences.</p>
<h2 id="case-xi">Case XI</h2>
<p>A (elder hand), having a quint major in clubs and the seven, places the quint major on the table together with the seven of spades, and says "Play six cards."</p>
<p>B plays five cards, and then takes the seven of spades with the eight. A then says, " I made a mistake; I intended to have played the seven of clubs." Can A rectify his error?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> A is too late after B has played his sixth card. But prior to that A can rectify his error</p>
<h2 id="case-xii">Case XII</h2>
<p>A (elder hand), has a tierce to a knave in clubs,good against the cards. He might also have had a tierce to a queen in hearts, but he has discarded from that suit. He calls a point in diamonds, and a tierce, but does not declare in what suit it is,nor to what card it is (Law 48). B (younger hand),plays on the supposition that the tierce is in hearts,and in consequence loses the cards. B then claims to play the cards again, on the ground that he has been misinformed (Law 59, par. V.), or, at least,that he has not been sufficiently informed.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B has not been misinformed, and has no right to have the cards played again. He might have protected himself by asking A to show the tierce (Law 55), or, what amounts to the same thing, by asking to what card the tierce is.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> As a matter of etiquette, it is usual among piquet players to volunteer information when there may be a doubt as to the nature of the claim. Thus the younger hand might have the point, good or equal, in more than one suit. After the elder hand has led a card, it would be in accordance with custom for him to say "In hearts," or whatever the suit may be; or, if he has a high card of his point out that might influence the play (his point nevertheless being good or equal), to show the cards.</p>
<p>In case no mention is made of the suit, the claim is generally understood, among players, to refer to the highest or best combination that can be held, in the case of the tierces, first given,to the tierce to a queen. If A and B are in the habit of playing on that tacit understanding,B has just cause of complaint, and A should endeavour to repair the injury inflicted on B, the simplest course probably being not to demur to B's request to play the cards again.</p>
<p>Similar observations apply to quatorzes and trios. Thus the elder hand has point and quart,both good, and might also have three kings and three tens, both good against the cards, but has put out a king. He should not call his hand thus :-" Five and four are nine, and three are twelve." He should say, "and three tens are twelve."</p>
<h2 id="case-xiii">Case XIII</h2>
<p>B (younger hand) accidentally takes up a card less than he discards. The mistake is discovered when the hand has been partly played out. B claims to take in the card he left on the table, the card in question not having been mixed with his discard.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B can take up the card he left on the table, unless he has announced that he will leave a card, when he must play with eleven cards.If B has not renounced in the suit to which the card belongs, the hand proceeds in the usual way. If he has renounced, Law 59, par. IV., comes into operation.</p>
<h2 id="case-xiv">Case XIV</h2>
<p>The younger hand (B) discards and takes up the bottom three cards of the stock before the elder hand (A) has taken in. A then says, "I leave a card." What is the consequence?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B having taken up a card of the stock cannot alter his discard; and, as in taking in he is obliged to take the cards in order from the top of the stock, including cards left by the elder hand, he must take the card left by A, must play with thirteen cards, and can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
<h2 id="case-xv">Case XV</h2>
<p>The elder hand holds king, knave, ten, nine,eight, seven of diamonds. He calls six cards which are not good, and a quint minor which is good.</p>
<p>During the play of the cards, the elder throws ten, nine, eight, seven of diamonds. The younger hand then says, "How many diamonds ?" The elder replies, "Two." The younger, supposing that the reply is only as regards the quint, plays accordingly and loses the cards thereby. He then claims to play the end of the hand again under Law 59, par. V.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> The question can only be asked with regard to cards reckoned for or called as equal. The reply, therefore, can only be with regard to those cards. The younger hand has been misinformed, and can claim to play the end of the hand again.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> This decision has been much disputed. Compare Case XVI.</p>
<h2 id="case-xvi">Case XVI</h2>
<p>In the contrary case, of a player's replying " One" (or whatever the number may be), when he has more which he has not declared, the adversary must take the reply to be in respect of cards reckoned as good or declared as equal.</p>
<p>For example: B (younger hand), who has discarded at least one spade, remains with three cards in hand, viz., ace, queen of hearts, and king of spades. He has not declared any point, aces, or queens, but has reckoned a quart minor in hearts. A (elder hand) has ace, queen of spades, and king of hearts. Before leading, he says, "How many hearts?" B replies, "None."No one disputes that B is justified in this, and that his reply is understood, by all piquet players, to mean, "None that I have declared."</p>
<p><em>Note</em> In both this and the previous case the question put is irregular. It should strictly take this form, "How many of your quint ?" or, "How many of your quart ?" as the case may be. Or,the request may be, "Show me anything you have declared" (Law 55). But as the irregularity is permitted by custom, it is assumed that the player who has to answer will frame his reply with reference only to cards called as good or declared as equal. This consideration guides the decision in Case XV.</p>
<h2 id="case-xvii">Case XVII</h2>
<p>A has thirteen cards in his hand. He does not notice it, but discards five cards and takes in five.After he has taken in it is discovered that he has in his discard a card belonging to the undealt pack. A claims a fresh deal under Law 75.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> There is no proof that when the pack was dealt it was redundant. The surplus card may have got into A's hand or discard after the deal was completed. A is liable to the penalty for playing with thirteen cards, and can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
<h2 id="case-xviii">Case XVIII</h2>
<p>The facts are as in the previous case; but A keeps in his hand the card belonging to the undealt pack instead of discarding it.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> In this case, if A has not played the surplus card he may return it to the undealt pack, and there is no penalty, unless A has used this card in scoring anything that is allowed to be good, or in showing anything that is allowed to be equal, and has afterwards led a card. He is then liable to the penalty for an unfounded claim, and can reckon nothing that deal) subject however to the possibility of his having held what he claims, in his hand and discard taken together, as provided in Law 54). If the surplus card has been played prior to the discovery of the error, the hands must be taken up and played over again, the surplus card being first removed.</p>
<h2 id="case-xix">Case XIX</h2>
<p>A plays with thirteen cards; B with twelve.</p>
<p>B wins the twelfth trick, and scores two for it.</p>
<p>A objects that the twelfth trick is not the last trick (Law 65), and that his thirteenth card, though not good to score, is good to bar the adversary (Law 58).</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> The word "last," in Law 65, presupposes that each player has twelve cards. B is entitled to score two for the twelfth trick.</p>
<h2 id="case-xx">Case XX</h2>
<p>A says, "Discard for carte blanche." While B is considering what he will put out, A places his discard face downwards on the table, and takes some cards of the stock. Can A then show his carte blanche ?</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> Yes, provided he has not mixed any of the stock with his hand. He must show his hand and his discard separately, as, having taken up a card of the stock, he must not retake any card of his discard.</p>
<h2 id="case-xxi">Case XXI</h2>
<p>In continuation of the former case, B, on seeing A take up a card of the stock, says, "You have not shown your carte blanche." A replies, "No more I have," relinquishes the stock, mixes his discard with his hand, and is about to show the carte blanche, when B objects, that A having taken up a card of the stock, and then retaken his discard, must play with seventeen cards, and can reckon nothing that deal.</p>
<p><strong>Decision</strong> B's contention is so far correct that A can reckon nothing after the carte blanche, which (so long as he has not mixed any of the stock with his hand) he is still at liberty to show and reckon. This score accrues before the play of the hand commences, and before any cards are taken in. Consequently, the law which bars a player from reckoning anything if he plays with too many cards does not apply to a carte blanche,</p>
<h2 id="case-xxii">Case XXII</h2>
<p>It is the last hand of a partie. A (elder hand) is sixty-two. B (younger hand) is ninety-two.</p>
<p>A holds ace, king, queen, knave, nine of spades; king, knave of hearts; knave of clubs; and ace, queen, knave, ten of diamonds. He has discarded eight, seven of hearts; eight,seven of clubs; and seven of diamonds.</p>
<p>B holds ten of spades; ace, queen, ten, nine of hearts; ace, king, queen, ten, nine of clubs; and king, nine, eight of diamonds (thirteen cards).</p>
<p>By mistake, he has only discarded two cards,viz., eight, seven of spades; and he has taken up together the three cards left in the stock. As he cannot alter his discard (Law 24), he is obliged to play with thirteen cards, and can reckon nothing that deal (Law 35).</p>
<p>The elder hand calls five cards, making fifty.The point is equal. The elder then calls a quart major, a tierce to a queen, and four knaves, good for twenty-one, and leads five spades. To the set the younger hand plays ten of spades,  nine, ten, queen of hearts, and eight of diamonds.</p>
<p>It matters not now what the elder hand leads. As the cards happen to lie, he scores most by leading king of hearts. B wins with the ace, and plays five clubs and divides the cards.</p>
<p>The scores are, A, 91; B (who reckons nothing) 92. B wins a rubicon (Law 73) of 283 points.</p>
<p>Now if B had played with twelve cards, he would have lost a rubicon. This is easily proved by taking from B's hand the card of least importance to him, say the eight of diamonds. A leads five spades, as before. It is immaterial what B plays. A must win at least the last two tricks, and the cards, and scores forty.</p>
<p>The scores are, A, 102 ; B, 98 (at most); but as probably B has seen he cannot save the rubicon, it may be taken that he has let A count thirteen in play, when the score will be A: 106 ; B: 92. A wins a rubicon of 298 points.
Hence B profits, by his own blunder, to the amount of 581 points. The example is taken from actual play.</p>
<p>Similar examples could be furnished as to the call of a player, with thirteen cards, barring a pique or a repique, and as to the extra card saving a capot.</p>
<p>The penalty of scoring nothing that hand, when a player has too many cards, may not only be no penalty at all, but may give the player in fault an overwhelming advantage. That this should be possible is a serious blemish in the game; and it is suggested that it should be provided against by future legislators.</p>
<p>It is the fashion to say that, in the long run, the habitually careless player will lose more than he will gain, by playing with the wrong number of cards. This appears to the Author to amount merely to a lame excuse for an inadequate law.</p>
